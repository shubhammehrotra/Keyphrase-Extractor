"This is a nice diaper pail, especially since I can use my regular kitchen trash bags and am not required to purchase special refill bags which are quite expensive.",[]
"When looking for a diaper pail my husband and I wanted something easy to use, no expensive refill packs, and of course something that would hold in odor.",[]
We found all that in the Diaper Champ!,[]
We've been using ours for almost 8 mths now and love it.,[]
"Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.",[]
You can get the discs most places you buy vaccum bags.,[]
This is a great prduct and I recommend it to all my mommy friends.,[]
"I purchased the ever popular diaper genie before I had my son, but was warned by several people that it was too small and difficult to use.",[]
"Then, I received the Diaper Champ at one of my showers.",[]
It's fantastic!,[]
It's twice the size of the genie and you can use ANY BAG--including the bags diapers come in.,[]
It's so simple to use and it has absolutely no smell.,[]
Our champ is placed between the baby's crib and the changing table!,[]
"When it's full, changing the bag is simple.",[]
I recommend this to all my expecting friends and am so glad I received it!,[]
Ok - newsflash.,[]
Diapers are just smelly.,[]
We've had this pail for 2.5 years now.,[]
It was our first and primary one.,[]
"There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.",[]
"Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.",[]
Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn't find one as good.,[]
(We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!),[]
We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn't notice a big difference in smell-control.,[]
(The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.,[]
)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that's pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.,[]
"I've knocked off a star since the mechanism isn't that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.",[]
"Plus there are some smell issues, as with any pail.",[]
"However, the fact that you can use regular trash bags is so much more convenient!",[]
I love this pail.,[]
In fact I purchased two.,[]
"I use one for all cloth items (diapers, soiled outfits...) and the other for disposable diapers and other trash.",[]
It uses your own garbage bags - I fill one with 2 gallons of water and borax and have never had a leak or a smell issue.,[]
My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
I think it works GREAT and it does conseal the odors.,[]
"Best yet, you can use any kind of tall kitchen bag, etc.",[]
"BUT... now our daughter is 14 months and we ""need"" to replace it.",[]
"I'm replacing it with the SAME, as it does work like a CHAMP.",[]
"Why... ya have to clean, scrub it down every now and then.",[]
"Inside the top is a FOAM seal, which eventually starts to deteriorate.",[]
I believe that is why we are now smelling diaper ordors.,[]
"But it worked wonderfully for over a year and I wouldn't want to test another pail, knowing this one will work for another year.",[]
A. Avins,[]
This is a good product to start and very easy to use.,[]
"But as baby gets older and begins solid foods, it is not effective as an odor controlling pail.",[]
It is simply a place to put dirty diapers.,[]
My daughter is now 10 months old and we had to remove the Diaper Champ from her nursery because it smells too bad.,[]
The ability to use the same bags I use in my kitchen and laundry room garbage cans is far and away a good enough reason to buy this unit over the genie.,[]
"Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?",[]
The answer to this question is not even worth thinking about - it's much easier to use the same bags.,[]
you couldn't ask for a better diaper pail.,[]
"one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.",[]
great product!,[]
This is a fantastic product.,[]
"It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell.",[]
"You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position.",[]
"When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container.",[]
"I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones.",[]
A good buy.,[]
"My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor).",[]
It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1.,[]
You can use any trash bag2.,[]
Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1.,[]
"The bag doesn't seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it's just like opening a regular trash can.",[]
Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2.,[]
"The plastic seems to smell, ie.",[]
"You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.",[]
"That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3.",[]
"The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor.",[]
"It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I'm talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!).",[]
Super-frustrating!,[]
"This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie.",[]
"*some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We're going to try another disposal system.",[]
This product is much easier to use than others.,[]
"I agree with other reviewers that this is a literally stinky product, the seal has a foam that absorbs odors.",[]
"Considering the high maintenace cost of other diaper disposal products, I figured out how to make this one stink-less.",[]
I also have a hard time believing that any diaper disposal is completely odor free without effort.,[]
"If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.",[]
Put dirty diaper and wipes in a sandwich bag before disposal.2.,[]
Use scented garbage bags.3.,[]
"Once a day, wipe the plunger, sides and seal with Lysol or Clorox wipes, both sides.",[]
Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.,[]
(You'll know what I mean if you see it.)4.,[]
"When the gaskets get old, you can call the company and they will replace them.",[]
Stink free.,[]
"I was set on the diaper genie until some friends of ours, who have a baby who is 7 wks older than our little girl, told us about the diaper champ.",[]
"There are two things that are very appealing about this - 1.  you can use your own kitchen trash bags, or any other large bag (you don't have to buy special ones!)",[]
and 2.,[]
"It rarely smells at all.We have used this for the last 5 months, and empty it only once a week.",[]
"By the last day of the week, you might start to notice an odor, but that's only if there are several messy diapers in it.",[]
"Every time I change the bag, I spray Lysol down in it, just to kill any possible germs.",[]
I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!,[]
It's easy to use and I am so glad our friends told us about it.,[]
"I originally had another pail and it broke after about 9 months of use, so I got this one.",[]
I love it!,[]
It is very easy to use and keeps the diapers away from little hands.,[]
It has a large capacity and cuts back on frequent trips to the trash can.,[]
I keep a stick on air freshner in the bottom and it helps with lingering smells.,[]
Also no expensive refills to buy!,[]
Great pail.,[]
"The first time I used this diaper pail was at [a store] in the ""family"" room and I absolutly loved it, so my husband and I went out and bought one (since the other one broke, understandibly from too much abuse).",[]
It keeps odor in and it is so easy to use.,[]
You just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.,[]
"There are no little breakable parts, so this pail can take lots of abuse (ours has).",[]
I have told all my freinds and family to stop using their other pails and buy this one.,[]
I would pay three times what they are asking to have this product!,[]
I own this original diaper champ and I couldn't have been more pleased with it.,[]
I got it when I had my first child and I will be using it again shortly with my second.,[]
We used the diaper champ until my daughter was potty trained (at 2.5 years) and never had a problem with it.,[]
Here are the highlights:1.,[]
No special bags to purchase.,[]
We used the GLAD ODOR SHIELD kitchen trash bags and the only time there was even a slight odor was when we changed the bags out.,[]
"I think my husband sprayed it with lysol and ""aired"" it out maybe every 6 months.2.",[]
No odor!,[]
See #1 comment.,[]
"Also, my sister-in-law had the diaper genie and every time you went near her son's room you wanted to clip a clothes pin on your nose!",[]
We kept our diaper champ in the bathroom next to the changing table (which usually smaller rooms hold smells longer and stronger) and no one could ever tell we stored dirty diapers in there.3.,[]
My husband loved it!,[]
"I think he mainly liked the ""thunk"" of the plunger every time he put a diaper in, but hey-anything that makes changing a diaper more fun for a guy is a good thing!",[]
:-)4.,[]
Easy to change.,[]
When we first got the diaper champ the latch to open and close it to change out the bag was a bit stiff and took some work to open.,[]
But within a few weeks it was easy to open but still firm enough to hold it closed securely.My final word:  I'm getting everythig ready for my next baby and just pulled the diaper champ out of storage (haven't used it for 2 years).,[]
I opened it expecting some kind of offensive odor and was pleasantly surprised when I couldn't really smell anything.,[]
"There was a trace of that ""plastic disposable diapers once lived here"" but you needed to literally put your nose right in it to smell that.",[]
"Overall, this is an excellent product and a great price too!",[]
Excellent diaper disposal unit.,[]
I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).,[]
I am soooo pleased with this product!!!,[]
A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!,[]
!,[]
We love our diaper champ.,[]
It is very easy to use just drop the diaper in and flip the top over.,[]
No need to stick your hand inside.,[]
"No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.",[]
"When it gets full, just put in a new trash bags.",[]
The best feature of all is that even the most curious little ones can't get into the diapers.,[]
"Before we found the diaper champ, we had another diaper pail and our son learned to open it and pull the diapers out.",[]
That is no longer a problem!,[]
!,[]
"We first had the Diaper Genie, but the proprietary bags make it lame and cost prohibitive.",[]
"With the champ you can line the bottom of the entire thing with costco's kirkland kitchen bags, then with each changing throw the stuff in a small produce or plastic grocery bag, then throw it in the champ and your good to go.",[]
It just works and zero I mean zero smell!,[]
"This is a good concept, easy to use, no special bags etc.",[]
"BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.",[]
"ALso, watch out for the smell.",[]
I feel like the plastic has permanenely absorbed the poop odor and no amount of cleaning or bleaching can get it out.,[]
I'm expecting another baby and don't plan on using it.,[]
Turned out to be a total stink bomb.,[]
Read my new review.,[]
It absolutely reeks after 16 months.,[]
Amazon will not let me alter the star rating or it would be only one starDo NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.,[]
It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.,[]
Not a good design.,[]
"[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.",[]
"We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.",[]
This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.,[]
*2) Effectively controls odors.,[]
"We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.",[]
"However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.",[]
That smell can bowl you over.,[]
*3) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with.,[]
"Many of the ""grown-ups"" in my world can't help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them.",[]
I'm thrilled they can't figure out how to open the DC.,[]
"As it emits a powerful odor when the lid is opened, I'm happy they can't figure it out.",[]
"I think this lid will confound any toddler, but it's really simple for parents once you get the concept down.I just wish it could empty its own ""payload.""",[]
I'll definitely be first in line for the Diaper Champ robot.,[]
Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.,[]
"They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.",[]
"My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.",[]
"The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.","[('drop', 0.07241357850357448)]"
"Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it's flip top access lid locks into place and doesn't plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it's neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.","[('secure', 0.0724135785035745)]"
"And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it's clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.",[]
"Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.",[]
The diaper champ begs to be knocked out.,[]
It is wishful to think that this contraption controls the stink.,[]
"If anything, it allows the diapers to ferment into a far worse state than if a person on a daily basis simply tied off the bag and took the soiled diapers out of the house.",[]
"Diapers don't really smell bad unless they are given time to ripen, for which the champ is perfect.",[]
The diapers actually smell far worse and stronger in the champ after a day than in a open paper grocery bag coupled with a plastic bag.,[]
"(i know my kid's waste stinks so believe me i know the paper bag works better and is easier for throwing out other baby-changing materials, dare to compare)The chute and sliding weight, while creative, is not that effective.",[]
The weight like some others have mentioned needs help towards the end of a bag and sometimes when the bag is not that full.,[]
My real problem lies with the chute.,[]
"If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.",[]
"Also, that means putting dirty wipes down the chute is a no-no b/c they will just soil the mechanism.",[]
"One person made a good suggestion of lining the chute hole with a plastic bag but i would prefer not to have bag the garbage b/f i put it in another garbage bag not to mention having to pull out a new bag for every diaper.Lastly, changing the bag is a pain.",[]
I'm a dexterous person but i've spent a number of times clawing this thing open.,[]
"Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.",[]
In my opinion the smell is minimal that way and nonexistent compared to a full diaper champ.Where or when is this thing the champ?,[]
At the baby shower this item lives up to its name.,[]
"Everybody ooohs and aaaahs, the presenter will be slapped on the back and carried around the room on everybody's shoulders.",[]
"It ""looks"" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.",[]
I gave this to dear friends and i was really proud of myself (even though my wife picked it out).,[]
"Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.",[]
The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.,[]
"Good luck, i'm going to go rub mine for luck.",[]
I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.,[]
"Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.",[]
"A couple suggestions: 1) as baby's poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.",[]
"This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it's not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it's very full.",[]
"But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.",[]
The Diaper Champ has done everything it is said to - contains dirty diapers with little or no smelly mess.,[]
"Our 19 month old son can now ""help"" mommy/daddy put away the ""poo-ie"" diapers.",[]
We were given a box of 500 trash bags - purchased from Sam's or Costco type places - and we haven't even come close to finishing the box.,[]
We've used the Champ since day one and love it.,[]
"No strangely twisted, sausage-link diapers to pull out and trash.",[]
"Easy to clean, little or no smell - I mean it holds diapers so when you open it to empty it you have to be prepared - but no odor during normal use.",[]
Definitely Diaper Champ!,[]
!,[]
Smell?,[]
No problem.,[]
Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?,[]
"Time to change the bag - no problem.Spray with Lysol once in a while to reduce germs/bacteria.If you're really grossed out by the smell when you change it, drop one or two dryer sheets inside before inserting the new bag.",[]
Or use about a half-cup of odor-killing kitty litter.My only issue is that the lid falls closed when I'm prepping a fresh garbage bag.,[]
I can live with that.,[]
"As a nanny, I used many different diaper pails.",[]
Now I have my own child I decided to give this one a try.,[]
"I like the design, the fact that I can use regular trash bags and also that I can use it for cloth diapers which we switched to after a couple of weeks.",[]
This is by far my favorite diaper pail.,[]
It is cost effective due to using regular bags and it does the job well.,[]
I have had a diaper genie for almost 4 years since my first son was born and I have been using it with my second as well.,[]
I thought I'd try the champ to save $ on the genie refills.,[]
Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags.,[]
"The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.",[]
The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.,[]
I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child's room-they wouldn't be able to get into it!,[]
"Don't waste your $ to ""save"" $!",[]
Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!!,[]
"Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!",[]
YUCK!,[]
"Before my first child was born, I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ.",[]
She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags.,[]
So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags.,[]
"My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great.",[]
It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all.,[]
"I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors.",[]
So far this has been a great product.,[]
"The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much.",[]
"Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly!",[]
But so far so good!,[]
!,[]
We got this diaper pail as a shower gift before my son was born.,[]
"He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!","[('run', 0.08916266806165124)]"
It didn't smell at all the first six months but once we started my son on baby food the smell was horrific!,[]
I understand that you have to change the bag often but this thing doesn't even contain the smell after one day of dirty diapers!But I guess I still like it more than the Diaper Genie.Bottom line - all diaper pails smell - so do you want one that's easy to use and can use regular bags or do you want one that require expensive refills and isn't as user friendly?,[]
"We bought 2 diaper pails, a Diaper Champ for downstairs and a traditional kind for upstairs.",[]
After just a couple weeks we bought a second Diaper Champ.,[]
Anyone who has ever had to change a diaper at our house is impressed with how easy it is to use.,[]
Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.,[]
We like that we don't have to buy special replacement bags.,[]
We just use a stick-on deoderizer and the cheap scented trash can liners on a roll (which last a very long while).,[]
"Our son is almost 10 months old and we have rarely noticed any escaped odors, except occassionally when the pail is full.",[]
Our only complaint would be that the diapers do tend to build up in the center making the handle hard to flip over.,[]
"But, a quick shake of the pail can solve that problem.",[]
Would definitely reccomend this pail over any other!,[]
I almost bought the Diaper Genie on name alone (my name is Jeannie!,[]
)and the fact that EVERYONE says you must get one (Well if everyonetold you to jump off a bridge...).,[]
Have you looked at the price of therefills????,[]
Think about the number of diapers you will use and the factthat every diaper needs its own cover.,[]
"It's a great idea, but the wholepoint is to eliminate odor, and the Diaper Champ does that while usingregular tall kitchen bags.",[]
"Also, the Diaper Champ only needs onehand to use.",[]
"There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.",[]
I highly recommend thisproduct.,[]
This is the best diaper pail ever made!,[]
The best things about this product are:1.,[]
No stinky diaper smell!,[]
"Guests don't smell it when they are in the bathroom with it, and I don't smell it when I put a diaper in!2.",[]
No expensive refills!,[]
You can use regular trash bags or aBummis Waterproof Bag (X-Large 40-54 Qt.,[]
"Diaper Pail-25""X29"")!3.",[]
I can drop a diaper in it with one hand if I wanted to!,[]
"Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!",[]
I love the Diaper Champ!,[]
"It holds a ton of diapers, it doesn't stink, it's easy to use, and you can use regular garbage bags instead of having to buy expensive refills!",[]
I can't believe how good the odor control is.,[]
I buy the cheap scented garbage bags from the Dollar Store and they keep any odor from escaping!,[]
I will never use anything else!,[]
For the first year and a half of my son's life I had been using the Diaper Dekor Plus system and since around the time he turned 1 his room just reaked of dirty diaper odor.,[]
This was really bothering me that my child's room constantly smelled the way it did.,[]
I decided to read the reviews and find a new diaper disposal system.I decided to go with The Diaper Champ.,[]
I was looking forward to not having to buy replacement bags all the time.,[]
I bought it and it's a lifesaver!,[]
My son's room finally smells like a baby's room instead of a dirty diaper.,[]
This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!,[]
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.,[]
"I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.",[]
Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!,[]
I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.',[]
"In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1.","[('diaper', 0.15697683947550656)]"
CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!,[]
I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.,[]
"For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!",[]
"Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.",[]
YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!,[]
"Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!",[]
All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!),[]
and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.,[]
"SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)",[]
"AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.",[]
"Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!",[]
"!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.",[]
I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!,[]
You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.,[]
My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.,[]
I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that's it.,[]
The Champ is definitely the best.,[]
I originally got the Diaper Genie because that is what every new mom thinks she has to have...so wrong!,[]
"My friend, who works at a daycare center bought me the Diaper Champ for my shower.",[]
I have no complaints!,[]
The Diaper Champ is soooo easy to use and it only stinks when you have to open it to change the bag.,[]
I have an 11 month old and I only have to change the bag once a week.,[]
I highly reccomend this product to all moms!!,[]
!,[]
We had 2 diaper Genie's both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).,[]
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.,[]
On top of that the refills are very expensive.,[]
So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.,[]
It is very easy to use with one hand.,[]
I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.,[]
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.,[]
It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).,[]
When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons.,[]
1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store.,[]
2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby.,[]
3) I'd heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie.,[]
"Now that I've had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I'm looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I'd drop a diaper in.",[]
The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag.,[]
"Eventually, the lining just fell out and that's when the smell became unbearable.",[]
"Not only is my daughter's nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin.",[]
It won't be returning for a come-back fight.,[]
I love the fact that it uses &quot;regular&quot; bags.,[]
I think it is truly odorless.,[]
"The only time I have noticed any odors, is when I am changing the bag.",[]
I have used the &quot;Diaper Genie&quot; at friends houses.,[]
"I feel it is way too complicated, maybe I am not depositing the diaper correctly in them, but with the Diaper Champ it is pretty much effortless.",[]
And very easy to do while holding a squirming baby!,[]
I purchased this Diaper Champ for our new church nursery.,[]
I wanted something that didn't require special refills to keep things simple.,[]
"It is very easy to operate (no one has had trouble with it and there is different staff in there every week), sanitary because it doesn't require you to smash the diaper down into a chamber like Diaper Genie, and quieter than Diaper Genie too because you aren't rustling with the plastic bag.",[]
"The only downfall may be that it's bigger and bulkier than the other brands, but that doesn't matter if you have ample space, or if it's basically out of sight anyway.",[]
I love the Diaper Champ!,[]
I have no problems with odor at all.,[]
"And you don't have to buy or use special, expensive bags!",[]
Any trash bag will work and it's great.,[]
I like the odor shield bags and they work like a charm.,[]
Easy to use one handed!!,[]
Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.,[]
This is the very best.,[]
So much better than Diaper Genie.,[]
No doubt about it.,[]
I would never buy Diaper Genie again.,[]
As a matter of fact I threw them out.,[]
"Here you have No Refills to buy, much easier to empty and put in a new garbage bag, a lot cheaper and most of all a lot quieter.",[]
The Diaper Genie is so loud when putting in a diaper in the middle of the night that is a pain.,[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
"In regards to smell?.....excuse me there are diapers in there, not roses.",[]
Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.,[]
If you're still picky put in an airfreshner.,[]
I received a Diaper Champ diaper pail as a gift.,[]
What a deception!,[]
It says ODOURLESS on the box -  but it does smell even when you drop the excess in the toilet!,[]
I read the instructions to make sure I was using it properly and still no difference.,[]
So I went shopping for a new pail.,[]
I'm now using the NEAT diaper pail and there are no odours.,[]
So I am now  satisfied.,[]
"We've had the Diaper Champ for 7 weeks, and it is wonderful!1.",[]
I love how easy it is to operate - flip the handle with one hand.,[]
"Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.",[]
"Apparently the &quot;other&quot; diaper pail is a little more complicated or requires two hands, based on what my sister-in-law said with hers.2.",[]
No stinky smells.,[]
"Your toilet would start to stink too, if you never cleaned it out....3.",[]
"Can use regular kitchen trash bags with it, instead of the expensive special bags.Would definitely purchase this again.",[]
We bought this pail because it used regular trash bags and hoped it lived up to all it says - IT DOES!!,[]
We use the scented trash bags and have had no trouble at all!,[]
"(It does get a little smelly when you change the bag, but that is expected)The only thing we don't like is the inside lid that holds the bag down.",[]
It does not stay up on its own.,[]
So when you change bags it has to be held open with 1 hand-leaving only 1 hand to get the bag out.,[]
It just makes it akward.My husband even recommends it!!,[]
So it has to be good.,[]
"Doesn't require special bags, which is a plus.",[]
"This worked pretty well for the first year of our daughter's life, while we were using disposables, although it doesn't contain the smell as much as we'd like.But once we switched to cloth, FORGET IT!",[]
This diaper pail was out of the nursery in a flash.,[]
"It was constantly jamming, requiring us to open the whole thing up and pull dirty wipes and diapers out of the drum mechanism.",[]
"Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.",[]
"Considering that we bought this pail specifically because it said it would work for cloth diapers, too, I'm pretty disappointed.",[]
I enjoyed the diaper champ until my 13 month old boy decided it was a fun to play with.,[]
He puts his toys inside the hole and flips it just like depositing a diaper.,[]
In my opinion this is a major flaw.,[]
"Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.","[('diaper', 0.12914971135741193)]"
The combination saves money and keeps the nursery smelling fresh.,[]
I would never use the diaper champ for poopy diapers because it does not contain the smell & cleaning is close to impossible (not to mention changing out the bag and having more of the soiled diaper smell hit)!If my toddler doesn't lose interest soon I will have to abandon the Champ!!!!,[]
My hope is that he does lose interest quickly.,[]
I just wanted to bring this to other parents attention because I never thought it could be such a fascinating toy for toddlers!,[]
While pregnant with my son I reviewed all the diaper pails and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable.,[]
I liked the idea of no costly refills and it was only a couple more dollars than the diaper genie.,[]
"It was easy to put together, however it is difficult to open and empty.",[]
My son is now 13 months old and the odor is noticeable.,[]
Even the pail itself stinks regardless of how often I scrub it ( I even use scented trash bags).,[]
"With dirty diapers you do have to expect some smell, I mean it comes with the territory, however I have to keep an air freshner plugged into the wall to help combat the smell.",[]
"It worked well for the first few months, but now I end up having to change the bags before they are even half full, which really seems like a waste.",[]
"I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.",[]
I really like the Diaper Champ.,[]
It is extremely easy to use and does a good job at containing that powerful 'diaper pail' smell.,[]
The fact that you can use ANY plastic bags is a big plus over the comparable Diaper Genie (which i have always found hard to use once there are more than a few diapers in there.,[]
)The only reason i didnt give this product 5 stars is that it is REALLY hard to open when it is time to empty it.,[]
(maybe this is just the one that i have?),[]
"Other than that, i'd purchase this product again.",[]
I got the diaper champ after hearing it needs no refills to it.,[]
I thought it was a good bargain...,[]
I WAS WRONG!,[]
It stinks so bad that I had to through it away after 1 month of use...,[]
I went out a bought the Neat...,[]
"I need to buy refills but, trust me it's worth it!",[]
"This is a great item for the first few months-very easy to use, doesn't stink.",[]
But give it a few months and look out!,[]
The smell is terrible!,[]
"I've tried baking soda, air fresheners (including the disinfecting ones), scented bags and have even gone so far as letting it soak in bleach for a day, but that didn't do squat.",[]
"Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.",[]
My son's room reeks since the smell seeps out 24/7.,[]
Off to buy a different one-too bad since my son enjoys depositing his diapers-until they get stuck and he gets frustrated!,[]
AVOID THIS ONE OR BE PREPARED TO SHELL OUT MORE $$ DOWN THE ROAD!!,[]
!,[]
We did a lot of research before buying a diaper pail.,[]
"So, of course we noticed that the Diaper Champ has a much higher user rating than the Diaper Genie.",[]
It works great!,[]
"We never smelled  a dirty diaper pail until my dd was like 9 months old, at which point it doesn't matter what kind of pail you have, it stinks!",[]
Those solid foods do amazing things.Buy this!,[]
Not the Diaper Genie.,[]
Save yourself the hassle and money.,[]
"This is a great product, so easy to use.",[]
I so far have had no smell.,[]
It is so easy to use.,[]
My daughter who is five loves helping me dispose of her little brothers' diapers.,[]
I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.,[]
Its nice not to have to buy special liners and so much easier to use than the diaper genie.,[]
I can't say enough good things about this product.,[]
What a fab product.,[]
We had heard great things about it before we put it on our baby registry.,[]
We liked the fact that you could use regular white tall kitchen trash bags.,[]
"Our little one is now almost 4 month old and we have had some really ""nice"" diapers by now and there has been no smell.",[]
It hold alot of diapers too.,[]
We probably change it every 5 days.,[]
Very easy to change the bag too.,[]
I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.,[]
Our baby's daycare even uses one in the infant room.,[]
This is a Wonderful product.,[]
"I purchased the diaper champ 10 months ago and for the first 8 months it worked well, then the foam inside that holds the odor in somehow came loose and started to hang down inside the diaper champ eventually falling away from the rim, now I have had to throw it away because the odor is terrible.",[]
I think my experience was just bad luck but thought it would be helpful for people to know that things can still go wrong with this great diaper champ,[]
"I have not used this item yet for diapers, but as for my first inspection upon receiving this as a gift...I found that every time I moved the handle at the top, the unit wobbled due to the poor design- large at the top with a small base.",[]
I noticed that some online stores sell a new and improved design that has a larger base at the bottom- I purchased the newer model and no longer have the wobble problem.,[]
The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.,[]
"However, my daughters' room smells so bad after only a few diapers are in there.",[]
"I spray it with Lysol, keep stick ups in there and even put the poopy diapers in powder smelling plastic bags.",[]
Yet her room smells every other day.,[]
"I too bought this so I wouldn't have to buy the refill bags but if I had to choose again, I would pick the genie.",[]
I love this diaper disposal system mostly because it uses regular trash bags.,[]
There are no refills to buy or anything extra.,[]
While it may still smell on occasion I think that is to be expected.,[]
"Whenever I empty mine, I also clean out the inside with a household cleaner.",[]
I bought this product at a resale store because it was REALLY cheap and I had heard alot of good about it.,[]
I originally was given a Genie so I was using that til I got this.,[]
I never had a problem with the Genie other than it gets expensive and it was confusing for others to use.,[]
"With the diaper champ though everyone can use it, it uses regular trash bags, and it keeps the smell out.",[]
The champ hold TONS of diapers!,[]
I have not had one problem with it and have had it for months now.,[]
I love this product!!,[]
!Alyssa mother of 21 month old and soon-to-be little girl,[]
This diaper pail is the best.,[]
Seriously.,[]
"My sister has the genie, putting a diaper in that is gross and squishy.",[]
"My friend has the ""odor-less"" and she says it basically ""stinks"" - the pail is odor less because all the odor is in the nursery.",[]
"The champ is easy to use one handed, easy to empty, keeps the nursery smelling good and the trash bags are cheaper than genie refills!I love this diaper pail!",[]
I decided to put the Diaper Champ on my baby shower registery after comparing it's reviews with those of the Diaper Genie.,[]
"I have to say, I'm glad I did!",[]
"Not only does it save me a fortune (I never have to buy special liners, any old bag will do), but it really does eliminate odor, even in the heat of summer.",[]
"My sister-in-law, on the other hand, had a baby at the same time as me and she received a Diaper Genie.",[]
"After a few uses, it is now collecting dust in her basement.",[]
"Her major complaints were the expensive liners and worst of all, the horrible odor!",[]
I am so glad that I did a little research and actually got a useful diaper pail.,[]
I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.,[]
We love this pail.,[]
Their are no odors.,[]
Just put the diaper in and flip.,[]
Grandma even loved it!,[]
It is such a time saver to only have to change the bag once a week.,[]
"Also, another plus is you can use regular garbage bags.",[]
You do not have to purchase refills.,[]
"One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.",[]
They sometimes stick to the inside and the diaper gets stuck.,[]
Using velcro tab diapers eliminiates this problem.,[]
Excellent buy and highly recommended!,[]
Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie?,[]
That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born.,[]
"Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me.",[]
She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that's what I went with.,[]
The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me.,[]
Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT!,[]
The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags.,[]
"I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too.",[]
it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it.,[]
"The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it).",[]
"I am glad for this, though, because if it's not easy for me to open, it won't be for my son, either.",[]
I love this item.,[]
"Other reviews rate it poorly because of smell, well, it is plastic and plastic absorbs odors.",[]
"Every week when we empty out the pail, I spray with Lysol disinfectant spray.",[]
"If my baby has an ecspecially smelly diaper, I double bag it just in case (ecspecially now that she's on real food!)",[]
Convenient and clean.,[]
"The only complaint, the lid can be a little rough to open and hold open when cleaning out, but no other complaints.",[]
:0),[]
My son is now a month old and he can have some pretty smelly diapers.,[]
The champ does a pretty god job of keeping the smell in.,[]
"yes it is going to stink when you open it up, as any diaper pail will, but the only time we really smell it is when it is really full.",[]
"The ease of use is wonderful, I definately do not like the idea of sticking my hands down a diaper geine.",[]
"As for getting poop smeared all over the inside, it doesn't happen if you insert the bag correctly.",[]
I love it and wouldn't trade it for any other kind.,[]
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!,[]
"It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)",[]
"and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it.",[]
"The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky.",[]
"HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me.",[]
"They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again!",[]
"(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!",[]
When my daughter was born we got a Diaper Genie because it was all that was out there.,[]
"It worked OK, but the refills were a hassle and by the time she was potty trained at 30 months, the smell of feces permeated the plastic.",[]
"So we bought the diaper champ when my son was born hoping that it would work at least as well.For the first 10 months or so, everything worked great.",[]
It kept what little smell there was in.,[]
The bags were the same as what we used in the kitchen trash can.,[]
"All good.At 12 months, my son's solid eliminations can be classified as WMDs.",[]
They smell so strong that even the cats leave the room running - these are cats that like to roll in smelly things that have been dead for a long time.,[]
He slowly built up to this level of toxic smell from essentially no smell at all.,[]
And now so has the diaper champ.,[]
"The champ is down for the count when it comes to keeping the smell in - and that's really the point behind a diaper system like this, isn't it?We are retiring the Champ for another Diaper Genie - the Genie was always a comprimise, but at least it worked marginally well when the going got tough...And if the Genie gives out, I will need to build an incinerator and apply for an EPA license for toxic waste disposal.Another two years of this smell is unacceptable.","[('genie', 0.1340998891464486)]"
"Although I had a Diaper Genie from my first child, which I hated, I registered for this for my second.",[]
I received very few items from my registry but this was by far the best gift I received overall.,[]
It is very easy to operate.,[]
My 4 year old feels a part of the diaper changes because he can work it.,[]
It keeps the smell out which makes mom and dad happy.,[]
"But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don't have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.",[]
It is definately a people pleaser!,[]
"Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.",[]
My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.,[]
"I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.","[('pail', 0.163942832175835)]"
"Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.",[]
"Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!",[]
"Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper.",[]
"We had purchased one of those ""other"" diaper pails, you know, the kind with the refills.",[]
We found one whose refills were less expensive.,[]
"Unfortunately, the brand went under or something, and we could no longer find the cartridges.",[]
Then we found this gem.,[]
"No refill cartridges, any bag will do.",[]
We use scented kitchen trash bags.,[]
"Our only complaint is that this isn't very airtight, and gets smelly quite quickly.",[]
"Other than that, the best diaper pail money can buy.",[]
We loved this pail at first.,[]
"The mechanism seemed ingenius, and we appreciated that it took regular bags.",[]
"But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it.",[]
"That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.",[]
"Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way.",[]
"It's really pretty scary.You'll notice that the positive reviews here generally say ""I've been using this for two months, and it's great!""",[]
"But once you have older babies, I'd retire it pronto.",[]
The product is great because it is not necessary to buy supplement products like the diaper genie.,[]
"However, it does not confine the smell of dirty diapers.",[]
I have to throw dirty diapers directly into regular trash right away.,[]
"Otherwise, it a very useful product to have.",[]
This is the best-designed diaper pail.,[]
All you have to do is drop in the diaper and turn the handle.,[]
There is nothing to push or twist.,[]
"And because it is taller than most other diaper pails, you don't really have to bend over.",[]
It also traps in odors well.,[]
"My sister-in-law had a Safety 1st diaper pail and my cousin had the diaper genie, but they both eventually wound up getting the Diaper Champ, which they love.",[]
"Also, because you can use any plastic bag, there are no expensive refills to buy, so it's also a money saver.",[]
"If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item.",[]
I highly recommend it!,[]
I bought this for my church nursery room.,[]
"At home we use the First years product, which isn't bad but not as good as this one.There are a couple of occasions that dirty diapers were left in it for a week but i didn't know because it didn't smell till I opened it to change the garbage bag.I think this is the only diaper pail that is cheap to use yet does the job well.Highly recommend.",[]
I'm extremely pleased with the Diaper Champ.,[]
"No special bags to buy, no bending over &amp; twisting anything, no smell.",[]
"I do wipe out the pail &amp; spray lysol when I change bags, but who wouldn't after it being filled with stinky diapers?",[]
I absolutlely love the easy flip handle - one flip &amp; the diaper is inside.,[]
Kudos to the girl @ the store who sold it to me for demonstrating how it works.,[]
The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the lid is a little difficult to open.,[]
"But regardless, I would suggest that this over any other diaper pail.",[]
I recently gave birth to my third child.,[]
"When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.",[]
"Not to mention that the ""sausage links"" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.",[]
"With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.",[]
I LOVE IT!,[]
"In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.",[]
"I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.",[]
"So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it's still a great product.",[]
I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.,[]
Our daughter is 13 months old and we've been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born.,[]
I highly recommend it because it's a great value.,[]
"However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1.",[]
Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.,[]
My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won't drop into the bag.,[]
Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.,[]
"It didn't seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.",[]
The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.,[]
The unit is top heavy when it's empty.,[]
I learned this one the hard way.,[]
When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.,[]
Ouch!!3.,[]
"No, the stink isn't completely trapped, but it's pretty darn close!",[]
The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.,[]
I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.,[]
"Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.",[]
Can't complain at all!,[]
"Sorry, this thing is a dog.",[]
"The blue plastic ring around each opening began to separate right away, and the top wouldn't swivel like it was supposed to.",[]
"I was able to get it working for a week or two with some lubrication, but it just got stuck again.",[]
"Wife hated it, I got tired of wrestling with it.",[]
Worthless.,[]
"We had heard from several friends that the diaper genie was difficult to use and expensive in the long run, so we decided to go with this instead.",[]
One of the best products we've ever had!!!,[]
I love it because I just use grocery bags inside-no need to get special bags.,[]
"Even though the diaper genie refills are not terribly expensive up front, long term cost would be unimaginable!",[]
We have not had any problems with an odor from the product.,[]
When we empty it (only once a week!,[]
"), we spray a little lysol in it.",[]
We store the can of lysol in the bottom so we don't forget.,[]
Have never had any odor from it at all.,[]
I recommend this to all of my new mommy friends!,[]
We love the diaper champ.,[]
It uses regular bags and contains the odor.,[]
The only time we've noticed a slight odor is if we haven't changed the bag in a while.,[]
We try to get as much us out of the bag as possible so we really jam them in there.,[]
"If we wouldn't do that, there would be zero odor!",[]
We love our Diaper Champ -- we have not had a problem with odors at all.,[]
"We change the bag every other day, and our daughter is only 2 months old, so maybe her diapers do not smell as much as an older baby's diapers do.",[]
"These could be reasons we haven't encountered an odor problem, but so far, so good.",[]
"It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.",[]
"I've used the Diaper Champ for 6 months now and I use Odor Guard bags, empty it every other day, and clean it out with Clorox Spray about twice a month and it still smells.",[]
The handle design is great and it's so easy to put the diaper in the pail.,[]
But for some reason it just doesn't hold the smell in very well otherwise it would be a great diaper pail.,[]
I haven't used other pails so I can't make comparisons but I'd probably get the Diaper Genie if I could do it over.,[]
I've noticed that the bags for DG go on sale a lot and aren't that much more expensive than the Odor Guard bags anyways.,[]
If you have a sensitive nose I guarantee you will smell this pail.,[]
My husband & I had received a tip from another parent that this was the must have item.,[]
"I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that.",[]
That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it.,[]
It is a complete life saver all around.,[]
"No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.",[]
Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.,[]
A little tip to keep the odor down.,[]
"I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.",[]
Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.,[]
"Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.",[]
It is a sure winner.,[]
You'll save a lot of money by using this one.,[]
"For the first few months, the Diaper Champ did a sufficient enough job of containing the odor.",[]
"But, as time has passed, I've become disappointed in our purchase.",[]
"We've used Lysol to clean the unit, and recently, I even soaked it down with bleach.",[]
That was not a good idea since I think it contributed to the stinky problem.,[]
"My husband discovered, upon disassembling to see if he could bring the Champ back to it's original usefulness, that there is a sponge lining in the top.The sponge lining is rotting away.",[]
"(Hence the bleaching not being the best cleaning route - I think it soaked into the covered/contained sponge, causing it to stink more by having no way to dry out.)",[]
"I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new ""diaper pail"" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.",[]
One man cited his wife breaking a nail.,[]
"I don't even have nice/long nails, but I always feared breaking the tip of my fingers off!",[]
"It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no ""residue"" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.",[]
"If it gets on the rubber gasket surrounding the weight, it is impossible to get the stink out of that area too.",[]
(That's the original reason I tried the bleach solution.,[]
)I'm in the process of deciding on which other diaper pail to try.,[]
"After the first $30 worth of cartridges for our two Diaper Genies, absolutely none of our babysitters or relatives being able to correctly work the Genie, and the desire to be able to watch my child on the changing table instead of fumbling with the diaper pail; I bought the Diaper Champ.",[]
All hail the Champ!,[]
"The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.",[]
The only discernable odor is when the bag is changed.,[]
"Since I have to change the bag less often and don't have to do the knot and cartridge dance, the relatively small amount of time to give the Champ a quick shot of Lysol is a pleasure.",[]
We have already saved enough money from not buying the replacement cartridges to buy a second Champ.,[]
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.,[]
"Not only did I buy it, I have bought it for my family and pregnant friends who also love it.",[]
"Easy to use, no smell, use your own bags (no buying refills)What more could you want?As a nanny, I have seen my share of diaper pails and this one beats them hands down.",[]
"I love this product...  My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter, and she has a diaper genie.",[]
She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges.,[]
"So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.",[]
Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.,[]
"With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.",[]
My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.,[]
"When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle!",[]
The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!,[]
!,[]
"I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.",[]
My baby's poop smells pretty bad; and our diaper champ has handled the smell just fine.,[]
"When we open it to change the bag, it smells pretty yukky, but nothing seems to escape when the thing is closed.",[]
"Best of all, it's easy to empty.",[]
"Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.",[]
Why not just chuck the diapers in the trash; and seal the poopy diapers in a plastic bag and put outside.,[]
"For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.",[]
Good buy!!,[]
!,[]
"I am so glad that I no longer have to shove that gigantic diaper into that little tiny hole(ahem, the diaper genie)!!!",[]
Good work people.,[]
Glad to see that someone has a grasp on reality.,[]
"Go, Diaper Champ, Go!!",[]
!,[]
I don't know how we survived the first year without the Diaper Champ.,[]
My daughter is now 13 1/2 months old and we still have an odor free nursery.,[]
"It's very economical, too.",[]
"Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it's going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!",[]
):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.,[]
I don't know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!,[]
And if I don't change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!,[]
Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can't be beat.,[]
We originally registered for the Diaper Genie.,[]
I sent an email to several of my friends asking their opinion and 8 of 9 told me that they hated the Genie because it was difficult to use.,[]
One even called it the Diaper Demon.,[]
"Another friend of mine, a grandmother, told me she would buy this for our gift because her daughter had such great success with it.",[]
We love it!,[]
There was only a quick snap on for assembly and it was ready to use in about 60 seconds.,[]
I wrap my diaper tightly before tossing them in there and haven't had an odor problem.,[]
I typically change the bag twice a week on trash days.,[]
"It is very easy to use, even while holding the baby.",[]
I do agree that it is harder to get open but I am hoping that will be a deterrant to a little girl when she starts tooling around soon!,[]
I love the fact that I can use regular trash bags and sometimes even buy the scented kind.,[]
I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.,[]
Love this product!,[]
"And now with plastic spray paint, you can even customize it by painting it the color of your baby's nursery!",[]
"We use Costco basic garbage bags and we fill it to capacity and still, we have no problems with odor.",[]
It comes nearly completely assembled (just add foot plate with a couple of screws) which is a far cry from what you need to do to set up the Genie.,[]
"Love the price, love the product.",[]
First I had the Diaper Genie.,[]
"It works fairly well, but was hard to use one handed and I got tired of buying refills.",[]
"With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.",[]
It works with regular garbage bags.,[]
"I've even used small shopping bags in a pinch, it just needs emptied more often then.",[]
"One thing I would like to point out, sometimes as the diaper champ gets older, it may start letting smells into the room.",[]
"If it does, all you have to do is email the company and they will mail you new seals free of charge.",[]
They get them to you fast too and then the problem is fixed.,[]
Great customer service.,[]
We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.,[]
All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!,[]
My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn't believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!,[]
We chucked the genie and bought the champ.,[]
"It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen.","[('diaper', 0.13793445559289536)]"
Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.,[]
We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.,[]
They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free.,[]
"Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.",[]
THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!),[]
"This is an awesome diaper pail, no smell, high enough so you aren't bending all the way down and cricking your already abused back, easy to turn, and no special bags to get.I usually use the lemon scented Kitchen Liners for extra good smell protection and loop the handles around the sides of the hole on the inside for easy removal.Yes the top is a little hard to lift up, but that is also what contributes to the no smell part so I don't mind, if it was easy to lift up then the smells would easily get out right?I also clean frequently with a clorox wipe after every bag removal but this holds ALOT of diapers...All in all good product, very pleased and I actually had another one on my registry until I read these reviews.","[('smell', 0.05792611951136501)]"
Why would you want to buy custom refills?,[]
With this pail you don't need them.,[]
"Just use ordinary, inexpensive trash bags, even recycle plastic grocery bags.",[]
It will pay for itself.,[]
Excellent odor control because you don't open the lid to drop the diaper.,[]
Almost fun to use.,[]
"I tried a friend's ""Diaper Genie,"" you need to be a genie to figure IT out.",[]
I didn't want to get the Diaper Genie because of the expensive refills needed to use the product.,[]
The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).,[]
"The mechanism doesn't let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can't get into the Diaper Champ!",[]
Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it's simple to open.,[]
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.,[]
"I used the Diaper Champ at my brother's house last summer....my nephew was 13 months when I moved in and eating all solids, so some of his diapers could clear a room.",[]
I can't think of a time when I smelled anything.,[]
It's easy to use and great at odor control.,[]
The best part...as he got a bit older he liked to &quot;flip the lid&quot; and &quot;put it in&quot; for me.,[]
When I have kids of my own I will for sure buy the Diaper Champ.,[]
I loved it.,[]
I love my Diaper Champ.,[]
It is simply more simple to use than the Diaper Genie.,[]
"If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.",[]
"I find it easy to clean, just using clorox or lysol disinfecting wipes and a quick spray.",[]
Occassionaly a diaper will stick.,[]
I notice this happens very infrequently if you wrap your diaper tightly and seal it with the velcro tabs (this also seals in mess).,[]
I use my Diaper Champs now for two boys (a 2 year old toddler and a 6 1/2 month old infant who recently started solid foods).,[]
With breast-fed infants there is literally no noticeable smell whatsoever.,[]
"With my solid food eating infants and my table food eating toddler, I notice an odor when standing directly over the Diaper Champ.",[]
"I keep one Champ in my family room next to our convenience changing table, and one in the nursery.",[]
Generally the Champ gets full and is emptied every other day (with two children).,[]
"The one in the nursery is only used for my toddler a couple times per day (because the baby is still on the first floor with us), but I empty that at least twice a week even if it is not full, or some of the more ripe diapers will cause an odor noticable upon entry into the room if left to sit for a period of several days.","[('toddler', 0.08916266806165124)]"
Overall I still think this is the best product on the market.,[]
I tried the Diaper Genie and just found it far to complicated and difficult to bother with and didn't appreciate the special bags required.,[]
I used this with my daughter and put it on my registry for my son.,[]
It was the ONE thing that I definitely wanted to use with him.,[]
There was absolutely no odor and I loved the fact that you could use regular garbage bags in it.,[]
"Plus, it is VERY easy to operate with one hand...a two year old could do it!",[]
This is an awesome product.,[]
My boss just ordered it for me so I am excited.,[]
"(I know, excited about a diaper garbage...how funny is that.)",[]
I wasn't sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie.,[]
I am so glad that I chose this one.,[]
I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice.,[]
It really holds in the horrible diaper smell.,[]
I love it and wouldn't trade it in for anything.,[]
This product worked well until my child reached about 12 months.,[]
I assume it was the larger size of the diapers.,[]
"At that point, the bin would be half full, but the diapers and wipes would keep popping out of the bin - which is just disgusting.",[]
I had to carefully wrap all of the wipes into the dirty diaper and fold each shut.,[]
Then waste (the bm variety) smeared all inside of the canister mechanism.,[]
I made a valiant attempt to clean it - which is utterly impossible with all of the crevices.,[]
"I went and bought another ""improved"" Champ.",[]
"I meticulously folded, rolled and fastened each diaper.",[]
But it happened again shortly thereafter.,[]
"I bought the least expensive ""simple"" diaper pail for $10 and I have not had a problem since.",[]
I chose the Diaper Champ for my baby registry instead of the Diaper Genie because of reviews I read here.,[]
I could not be more satisfied.,[]
"This thing is the easiest, best working baby product I own!",[]
It is everything it claims.,[]
It was so easy to assemble and even easier to use.,[]
"The only time you catch a whiff of diaper is when you change the bags (which are cheapo regular trash bags by the way, not expensive refills).",[]
Keeping a little Lysol handy completely handles that problem.,[]
This will be the gift I get every new mom from now on even if they have registered for the Genie.,[]
The Genie is a pain and WAY too much trouble.,[]
the designer of the Champ was brilliant!!,[]
( I wrote this when my child was not quite 2 months.,[]
"He is now 6 months and in bigger diapers and eating baby food, thus more smelly poop, however the Champ is still going strong.",[]
No odor problems and still as easy to use as ever.,[]
I came online to buy 2 Champ's for new baby gifts!!),[]
I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.,[]
(The Genie requires use of their own bags.),[]
The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.,[]
"The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.",[]
"There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I've had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.",[]
"For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.",[]
"Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I've had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.",[]
"Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn't open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).",[]
It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.,[]
This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.,[]
"Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.",[]
"And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one's excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven't seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.","[('job', 0.09663352620969101)]"
"With any diaper pail, it also helps to follow sanitary guidelines put forth by most municipalities to flush solid waste if possible, instead of tossing diaper and all contents into the trash.",[]
It's really not that much effort; you're going to wash your hands anyway; and it drastically reduces the odor.,[]
Bad construction is my main issue.,[]
"My husband assembled it and when changing the bag, you're supposed to open up the top head part which tilts back.",[]
"There's a little plastic tab that's suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get's cought so it allows the top to open up only partially.",[]
"It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I've given up on diaper pails in general.",[]
"Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly.",[]
I received for and received this as a shower gift.,[]
"There are many benefits to the diaper champ 1) easy, one handed operation 2) no costly refills 3) anyone can use it 4) its light enough to carry to the laundry room to wash diapers.",[]
"Other people have said that it stinks, but I wash mine everytime I change the bag (we use the glad tie bags and they work great) and I have not had any odor problems yet.",[]
The lady at Babies R Us recommended this to us over the Diaper Genie and she was a mother of five.,[]
I am satisfied with this product and will use it for awhile.,[]
I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time.,[]
"I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty.",[]
Very simple to put the diapers in.,[]
"We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb.",[]
Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore!,[]
Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day.,[]
It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else.,[]
There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail.,[]
This pail is great!,[]
I've used it six weeks now.,[]
"It does start to reject the diapers when it gets full, but you just have to push on the cylinder.",[]
This just tells me it's time to empty it.,[]
There is no odor except when emptying the bag (a very quick and easy process).,[]
"I love how easy it is to use, that you use regular trash bags (which saves money), and how sturdy it is, as well as the one hand operation.",[]
A terrific buy!!,[]
!,[]
This is on my list of must haves.,[]
The thing has been in my bedroom for 6 months.,[]
Not once have I ever smelled an odor from this thing.,[]
"I love that I can use any kind of bag so I just buy those super cheap super flimsy tall size garbage bags.The only drawback, as with all diaper pails, is that as the baby gets bigger and the diapers get bigger, you have to change the bag more often.",[]
"Our baby is 6 months and we fill it about once every 36 hours.But still, I wouldn't trade it for the world.",[]
Diaper catches and jams in the well and that is particularly nasty when the diaper is dirty.,[]
"Also, it is impossible to get it 100% clean after such a jam, which causes the oder to persist.",[]
I have given up and am now throwing my Diaper Champ away and getting something new.,[]
"As a mom of 3, I've had some experience with diaper pails.",[]
"Our first was the diaper genie, which did a great job of containing odors, but I wanted one that could simply use a standard garbage bag (my environmental conscience was bugging me--bad enough I was using disposable diapers!).",[]
"Finally, my in-laws did some babysitting, couldn't figure out how to replace the cartridge, and broke it.",[]
So I shopped for a new pail for baby #2......and bought the Diaper Champ.,[]
"From day 1, it smelled!",[]
"I was surprised since the mechanism seems to be pretty well sealed, but nothing I could do stopped it!",[]
"I put up with it since I spent ... on it, and after about 8-9 months of use, it broke!",[]
"The weight in the plunger broke through the plastic seal and fell into the bottom (and this time, no one manhandled it)!",[]
"We tried to repair it, to no avail.",[]
"From that point forward we just took the diapers to the kitchen can, and emptied them every night.If anyone finds a better can, I'd love to know!",[]
Baby #3's diapers are getting stinkier and stinkier!,[]
Good luck!,[]
Don't listen to the bad reviews!!!,[]
This is really a nice diaper pail.,[]
I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.,[]
"In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.",[]
Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.,[]
Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.,[]
I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.1.,[]
The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!,[]
We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.,[]
We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!2.,[]
It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.,[]
So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!,[]
"With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.",[]
The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.,[]
"He thinks it is magic when the diaper ""disappears"".3.",[]
Bags are easy to change.,[]
"Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.",[]
"To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.",[]
"It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.4.",[]
It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!,[]
"Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.",[]
"Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!",[]
To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.,[]
Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.,[]
Works great!!!!5.,[]
The price is right.,[]
At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.,[]
Our son is 18 months old and we have had a Diaper Genie for all of that time.,[]
"But with another baby on the way,a two-story house, and with the cost of refills we decided to go with the Diaper Champ.",[]
The reviews here on Amazon really sold me - especially the opinions that there was no odor-problem.,[]
We went with the Diaper Genie in the first place because we were told it had superior stink control.,[]
And that was true - we never even noticed that there was a stinky in the room once it disappeared into that Diaper Genie film sausage.,[]
But after only half a week and a not completely full Diaper Champ the reek from his room was very powerful.,[]
"Lysol spray helped, as did emptying the Champ, but the smell lingers.",[]
We were very disappointed after the performance of the Genie on odors.,[]
"That being said, I still think the design of the Champ is superior to the Genie.",[]
The one-handed operation had me gushing as did the ease of emptying it.,[]
"It holds more diapers overall and is much intuitive than the  Genie, which I have often had to wrestle with to get new refills into.",[]
"We will stick with it and take extra steps to manage the smell - but other than a quick wipe over the outside I have never had to clean my Diaper Genie, so this seems like a more high maintenance product in that respect.The one downside to the ease of use is that my son knows how to flip the handle and I am just waiting for toys and the like to disappear into the poo pit...  he never took any interest in the  Genie and I now say ""no, it's yucky!""","[('interest', 0.07724687716933615)]"
more than ever before.,[]
"The Diaper Champ is great because you can use regular garbage bags, rather than special refill cartridges.",[]
It also contains most of the dirty-diaper-smell.,[]
We use the Diaper Champ for wet diapers and the Diaper Genie for soiled diapers.,[]
This cuts down drastically on the cost of getting refills for the Diaper Genie.,[]
"With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.",[]
I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags.,[]
"I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great.",[]
There is no diaper odor in our nursery.,[]
"When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!",[]
").If you don't clean things, they don't smell clean.",[]
This isn't rocket science.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I don't like the opening mechanism on the front.,[]
But I can't think of any way they could've done it differently that would be as effective.,[]
I have used the Diaper Champ for 20 months now and I love it.,[]
"Yes my son's diet and bowel movements have changed, but it still works great.",[]
I just think some of you have gotten a bad one.,[]
There is always a lemon in the bunch.,[]
I will buy one for my sister-in-law when she has her shower next month.,[]
"Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It!",[]
This product stinks - literally.,[]
We had a second-hand diaper genie that was falling apart so we thought we would give the Diaper Champ a try.,[]
We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.,[]
"Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.",[]
But then whenever we had a poopy diaper to put in it - we started noticing it did not contain or mask the odor AT ALL!,[]
Not even temporarily for a couple hours.,[]
"When my daughter was being breast-fed only, this probably wouldn't have been as noticiable since poopy diapers don't have much smell for breast-fed babies.",[]
"But now she takes solids in addition to breast milk and her diapers can be quite, shall we say, ripe???",[]
"Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.",[]
I should've known better when I noticed the foul smell in the room of a child of some friends of ours - they used this product too.,[]
I thought they just were lax in changing it but no.,[]
The mother recently told me she had to throw it out because they could not get the bad diaper smell out of the plastic.,[]
I know the diaper genie can be a pain - you have to use their bags and the twisting mechanism and emptying it is cumbersome - but at least it contains the smell.,[]
I would stick with that - I wasted $30+ on this worthless diaper champ.,[]
I've been using this diaper pail for 2 and 1/2 years and I LOVE it.,[]
I can buy inexpensive scented bags from the grocery store and I just use recycled grocery bags to wrap-up the poopie ones.,[]
My son's room has NEVER smelled at all!I do lysol it every once in a while.,[]
"But that's all I've had to do.When I'm at friends' houses that have the diaper genie, I've been confused about how to use it.",[]
No one has ever been confused about how to use ours.,[]
Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.,[]
It suprises me to read all of these reviews saying that the diaper pail stinks up a room!,[]
DUH!,[]
It's full of dirty diapers.,[]
"Personally, we never had that problem too much.",[]
The nursery smells a bit sometimes but I think you would have that with every diaper pail.We got this one because we use cloth diapers and don't want each one mummified in it's own cocoon.,[]
I used this for my first two kids.,[]
We threw it out when we moved but now that the third is here we are going to get a new Diaper Champ.,[]
"This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.",[]
I use a grocery bag and change it once a week.,[]
I've also used grocery bags and you don't have to change it as often.,[]
"It never smells, I left for 2 weeks with my daughter and told my husband to take it out on garbage day while I was gone(we all know how husbands are)I got home and he forgot to do it, you would of never known there was a ton of dirty dipers in my house.",[]
I recommend this to all my friends and family.,[]
I was at an open house this weekend looking at a home I might buy...you could smell the diaper pail through out the entire house.,[]
It was really strong when you were in the baby's room.They had this diaper disposer.,[]
I finally suggested to the listing agent that she might try putting some baking soda in it because everyone is going to think the problem was with the carpet!,[]
"My sister got this for us for the new baby due in April but our 2 year old is still in diapers so I figured, why not use it now?",[]
I wish I had this thing for the last 2 years!,[]
It's great and it's so easy to put together and use.,[]
It's so much better then the Diaper genie (which I have never owned but have used at other people's houses.),[]
I love that it uses a regular trash bag and it saves so much money that way..unlike the Genie that you have to buy the dumb cartridges for.,[]
I highly recommend this product!,[]
I know 4 other people who are pregnant right now and I am going to tell them all about it!,[]
We have twin 18 month girls and the Diaper Champ hasn't let us down yet.,[]
It has had no problems with the parts not working.,[]
"We use the same size trash bag (13 gallon) as our kitchen trash and the other trash can in the nursery, so getting the right size bag is simple when sleep deprived.For people concerned with smell:  it only takes about 2 seconds to fold the dirty diaper so that all the poo is on the inside.","[('poo', 0.096633526209691)]"
The only times we've had any smell is when a couple particular relatives just dropped dirty diapers or wipes in as is without folding them up first.,[]
All we did was simply clean it and then educate the relatives.,[]
There has never been a smell since!We also only change it once a week...with twins!,[]
"We simply have another regular trash can in the nursery for wet diapers, used but clean wipes, and all the other trash like clothing tags, those little plastic hangers, kleenex, animal crackers etc.I understand that some people have had problems with it not working well but it's bound to happen that out of the tens of thousands manufactured some will have problems.","[('problems', 0.12055715332390199)]"
We had problems with one crib but not the other.,[]
"Never any problems with the champ though.One side note:  for a curious, organizationally minded 18 month old, the champs disposal chute is a great place to drop socks, toys, pacifiers and other objects so look before you flip the tube.",[]
"Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.",[]
I have to say that this is a great product.,[]
I have been using it for almost 2 years now and I have not had a problem with oder other than when you change the bag.,[]
I had a diaper genie with my other children and the diaper champ is soooooo much better.1) IT can use any bag!,[]
No expensive refills just plain old kitchen bags.2) IT locks in oder.,[]
"Yes, you have the smell when you change the bag, but you get that with the Diaper Genie when the ""Sausage roll"" unwraps.",[]
"As far as a build up of oder in the unit, I sprinkle a little baking soda in the bottom and voila problem solved.3) You can operate it one handed.",[]
"All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.",[]
"And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.","[('unit', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"I originally gave this product a 5 star review, but I was forced to edit the review after 3 months of use.",[]
"I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.I used this pail with both cloth and disposable diapers (during different time periods).","[('mess', 0.10572648305920108)]"
"The first month it worked great for both, in my opinion, although it didn't hold near as many cloth diapers and they occasionally needed some help getting into the pail.",[]
"However, once my baby grew into the next size of cloth diapers, it was IMPOSSIBLE to use the champ with them.",[]
"Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.",[]
"I did NOT call the company for a replacement as the other reviewer did, because I cannot use the pail with my cloth diapers.This pail has become garage sale fare.",[]
Diaper Champ is great.,[]
But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.,[]
"So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!",[]
Love this diaper pail-- saw a review of it on the Today show as well.,[]
They recommended it over the more known diaper genie and I agree!,[]
"In my opinion, no matter what diaper pail you use-- it's going to stink (my sister-in-law has the genie and it stinks as well).",[]
I stick a box of baking soda at the bottom of the diaper champ and replace it once a month and I use the glad fresh smelling kitchen garbage bags-- these have eliminated the odors-- including when opening it to empty it!,[]
I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it.,[]
I just live it!!!,[]
"It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby.",[]
"It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!!",[]
"I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!",[]
!,[]
"As a mom of three who has used both the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ, I am proclaiming the Diaper Champ the winner, hands down.We used the Genie with our oldest daughter.",[]
"I was quickly unimpressed by it's lack of odor control, and later grew weary of paying for the refill cartridges.",[]
"But it was better odor control than a simple trash can, if only slightly, so we decided to keep using it.Fast forward six years to our third daughter, now 3 1/2 months.",[]
I saw Diaper Champ in the store when I was still pregnant.,[]
"I was intrigued with the regular trash bags it used, and liked the fact that it is never truly ""open""; with the flip-flop top, the odor does not have as much chance to escape.",[]
"Still, I resigned myself to some amount of perpetual odor.I needn't have been.",[]
"While occasionally a small amount of diaper odor escapes while the lid is flipping over, and of course when you are changing the bag, in general there is no odor between diaper changes.",[]
NO ODOR!,[]
Really!,[]
"And this is also with my middle daughter's ""toddler poop"" diapers in it.My only regret is that I did not find the Diaper Champ earlier!",[]
I got the diaper champ for my first baby.,[]
I thought it would be great since it used regular trash bags.,[]
It wasn't even two weeks after my son was born when the seal came out and his room smelled awful.,[]
I threw it away.,[]
It was the biggest waste of money.,[]
I bought the Diaper Genie and it's worth having to buy the special bags.,[]
It works wonderfully.,[]
I bought this diaper pail after buying and returning the Diaper Genie TWICE.,[]
"I had a lot of trouble with the Diaper Genie individually wrapping each diaper like it was supposed to - the bag just opened up and unravelled with each new diaper, putting them all together.",[]
"Finally, I gave in and decided to save myself some money and aggravation.",[]
"I have had no problem with odor except, as others have mentioned, when changing the bag.",[]
"We went away for 10 days and I forgot to empty the nearly full pail, and I expected there to be at least a slight odor when we got back, but you couldn't smell anything.",[]
"Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.",[]
I definetly would recommend this pail to all.,[]
I really like this diaper pail.,[]
"It is easy to use, and economical too - no special bags to buy.",[]
You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.,[]
Then changing the bag is as simple as flipping open the top and tying off the bag.,[]
The only flaw I can see so far is that it tends to get jammed if the bag is getting filled up.,[]
You really can not appreciate this device until you've used it.No smell unless you don't empty it for a week or more.,[]
An airtight vault it's not....but it does what it's designed to do very well.Who doesn't take out the trash more than once a week ?,[]
Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who's thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,[]
it was great for the newborn diapers but it is starting to get a little stinky now with my 6 month old's diapers.,[]
we change it every few days which helps.,[]
We also use a little lysol in it every time we change the bag.,[]
"Overall, i think its worth the $$ we saved without having to buy specialty bags but it is high maintenance in order to keep the smell from lingering...",[]
"I got this as a gift for my baby shower, and I love it!!",[]
"!You can use regular garbage bags (so no need to spend money on costly refills), it's easy to use and it doesnt smell.I highly recommend this product!!",[]
!,[]
Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!,[]
I originally bought this rather than the Diaper Genie because I did not want to have to buy special bags but what a mistake!,[]
If you do not use deoderized bags you will need to change the bag every single day because if there is one poopy diaper in there it smells really bad.,[]
I actually threw out the Diaper Champ that I had bought and got the Diaper Genie instead which is 100X better!,[]
This product isn't that bad... however it is not smell proof.,[]
"I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant.",[]
"After using my sisters diaper Genie, I decided anything can be better than it and I was right.",[]
"The diaper champ is very easy to use, even with baby in hand.",[]
You don't have to purchase special trash bags either.,[]
You put your diaper in flip the handle and thats it.,[]
And it holds more diapers than any other diaper dumper.,[]
Price & comparison it is the BEST!,[]
I received the Diaper Champ for a shower gift and this it is great!,[]
It is so easy to dispose of the diaper with one hand and I have yet to smell any odor.,[]
Great product!,[]
this is the one to buy!,[]
"I was tired of making special trips to the grocery store just for diaper genie refills, until I bought the diaper champ.",[]
You just put in a regular garbage bag and it is ready.,[]
No smell or hassel with refills.,[]
Definitely a great buy!,[]
"I am glad my friend told me about the diaper champ, because otherwise I would have gone in for the diaper genie.",[]
"This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.",[]
"It is also bigger than the genie, and the best part is, you can use regular garbage bags in them.",[]
Isn't that just PERFECT?,[]
"Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.",[]
"It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective.",[]
It is easier to use.,[]
"There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well ""hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers"".",[]
Makes sense.,[]
.,[]
but still use it for wet diapers.,[]
Hopefully potty training will happen soon!,[]
":)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so ""diaper genieized"" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.",[]
"But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable.",[]
I highly recommend it to anyone!,[]
My cousin recommended this and said it kept out the smell so I was excited to use it and then all I smelled in my daughter's room were smelly diapers.,[]
Not sure why but this plastic thing didn't work for me.,[]
Now I just use a vintage diaper pail stainless steel step can with a paper bag on the bottom to absorb the odors.,[]
I replace the paper bag every once in a while and now it's fairly odor free.,[]
"We bought the Champ 3mths ago (still no odor, still going strong), mainly on a recommendation and the fact that you could use your own bags!",[]
I mean come on...we have enough to keep up with on the shopping trips!,[]
"Diapers, formula, nipples, wipes, bottles, disposable bottle liners, etc.",[]
Using the Champ meant I didn't have to buy and REMEMBER to buy special bags.,[]
"This Christmas we went to Grands house, 3000 mi away.",[]
They had bought every thing for a nursery at their home except a diaper disposal.,[]
"So, we just happened to pass the Diaper Genie in the store and picked it up.",[]
I wanted to see how it compared to our Champ at home.,[]
No comparison!,[]
Only once did the Genie actually enclose the diaper correctly.,[]
The other times we had to lift the lid and turn the inside dial ourselves...YUCK!,[]
So yes it is the best!,[]
The diaper champ does well with containing smells.,[]
It's not 100% but doubt anything really is.,[]
The problem I have with it is when I try to throw away wipes or misc paper trash.,[]
The thin stuff often gets caught in the turning mechanism and then tossed out onto the floor with the next turn.,[]
I have had to train myself to wrap all of the wipes used in the diaper to save myself from cleaning the carpet... again.,[]
I have really appreciated using regular trash bags and generally like the product.,[]
I just can't throw anything but diapers away reliably.,[]
"Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me",[]
What an awesome find.,[]
I had to decide between this and the Diaper Genie.,[]
"I chose this model because you can use ANY bag with it, which reduces the cost of having to get a specific type of bag just to discard dirty diapers.",[]
It also does an excellent job of keeping the smell away.,[]
It's easy to use and a cinch to keep clean.,[]
I purchased the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and also expensive to continually have to purchase the refills for it.,[]
I then purchased the Diaper Champ and love it!,[]
It is a cost saver as you can use plastic bags from the grocery store as the bags for it rather than having to purchase bags like the Genie.,[]
The only problem I encountered with this product is the odor occassionally.,[]
I would suggest only disposing diapers with urine in them in the Champ.,[]
I dispose of the diapers with BM directly in the outdoor garbage.,[]
This will take care of the smell that I originally experienced with the Champ.,[]
I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.,[]
Love the idea of not having to buy pricey bags to refill.,[]
Very easy to dispose of dirty diaper.,[]
It is great you don't have to shove your hand in any where.,[]
The only bad side is that there really is no air tight barrier between the dirty diapers and your nose.,[]
The smell from just one &quot;poopie diaper&quot; leaks out.,[]
This would be a perfect product except for that.,[]
Over all though not bad if you change the bag daily.,[]
"I have a 12 week old son, and yes he isnt on solids but I am also writing the opinion of my sister who has had one for 3 years.Its so easy to put a diaper in, if you change it frequently (I can get away with every 4 days, my sister changes hers every 2 days...) and it never smells.",[]
Theres no WAY a toddler could open the thing either.,[]
"Its great at what its supposed to do, hold dirty diapers and keep out the smell!It is pretty large, bulky, and to say the least... unatractive... but I found that ALL diaper pails let out an odor, all diaper pails have to be changed frequently and NO diaper pail will work magic... becuase baby diapers STINK!When I put in a new bag, first I use the very cheap scented bags, and I always spray Lysol inside and than let it air out on the upstairs canopy every so often (that means not moving it too far away).",[]
"I also found with the VERY stinky diapers, just put them in a plastic baggy, and spray a drop of cheap perfume inside (like the kinds from giftbaskets that no-one uses) this keeps ALL the smell out of my sisters, and my pail.",[]
"ITs simple, cheap scented garbage bags, air it out, lysol, scrub it once a month, and put the stinky diapers (not everydiaper mind you) in a plastic bag and add a sprits of cheap perfume if its unbearable...I find that EVERYONE has a smell issue with ANY pail if they wait till it gets full, or if they just plop any diaper inside it.","[('pail', 0.0827748537602753)]"
"You also have to CLEAN THE THING, its a diaper pail, you have to scrub it once a month...",[]
But I bet a garbage pail with the previous advice would work fine (I recieved this Champ as a gift though).,[]
All you need for stinky diapers is a pail with a tight lid and some good smelling things...,[]
"So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works ""okay"" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...",[]
I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...,[]
"Unfortunately, my experience with the Diaper Champ hasn't been the rosy one other reviewers have had.",[]
First of all - my comments here are based on a year's worth of experience with the Champ in use.,[]
"I've done everything from change bags on a daily basis to scrubbing it frequently with bleach, and spraying it down with Lysol.",[]
I've done everything I can think of to not waste my investment in this product.,[]
Nothing contains the odors it started to let out after about the 5th month.,[]
"I phoned the Diaper Champ customer service to ask what to do about the smell, the girl on the line told me the smell is normal as about every 6 months the seals on the unit need to be replaced.",[]
Nowhere in the instructions I received did it say that this would be necessary.,[]
"Furthermore, DC Customer Service said that I'd have to phone in every 6 months to have them send out my free replacement kit to maintain my unit.",[]
Incorrectly wrapping your diapers before putting them in the unit can hasten this process as a loose tape can wreak havoc with the foam seals.,[]
"After a year of putting up with the smell and changing out seals with no success (the smell just got worse with time and now seems to be in the plastic itself), I'm retiring the Diaper Champ and buying a Neat!",[]
system with my fingers crossed for better luck.,[]
"We keep the Diaper Champ in our utility room, along with the stinky cat litter boxes.",[]
We find the product works well.,[]
"The smell isn't totally gone, but it does minimize it quite a bit, and it's much cheaper than having to buy all those diaper genie refills.",[]
"For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.",[]
"Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -",[]
I truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market...,[]
"It's simple to use, can take any garbage bag, and does a fantastic job of containing odors.",[]
"BUT, my complaint is -- why couldn't they make it bigger?I've heard it's the biggest one you can buy, but I find it frustrating that my regular kitchen-sized garbage bags are only 2/3 full when the Diaper Champ requires us to remove the bag.",[]
It's wasteful!,[]
"(I know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags, but I feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag -- the ""tall kitchen bags"" -- and do it efficiently.",[]
The whole point of getting the Diaper Champ was so that we wouldn't have to buy separate bags for it!),[]
no matter how i scrub it - it stinks!,[]
its just a plastic garbage pail.,[]
don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.,[]
"but to be honest, they haven't perfected any of them yet.",[]
so the choice is between smelly and smellier.,[]
good luck.,[]
"With twins I don't have time to fiddle with special bags, or worry when I'm out.",[]
"The Diaper Champ allows use of any bag that fits, really, like the same bags we use in our kitchen trashcan.",[]
I can't imagine having to use special fitting bags to throw away diapers.,[]
I like the Diaper Champ.,[]
My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers.,[]
"I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up.",[]
I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags.,[]
I do wipe it down a couple of times a month.,[]
I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside.,[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers.,[]
"In reading some of the other reviews, I think it's all been said but I guess I'll say it again anyway.",[]
":)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.",[]
My husband and I tend to let it get to the point that we have to actually push the plunger down to get the diaper to go in and still the nursery is odor-free for playing or sleeping.,[]
"And I must admit, I have a 1 yr. old who eats everything under the sun and even when it comes time to change the bag, it's not that bad.",[]
Tie it up fast and you're good to go.,[]
";)  I will admit that it can be hard to open, but if it were easier, I'd have dirty diapers strung from one end of the room to the other because of my busy boy!!!",[]
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!,[]
Pretty stinky when its time to change the bag though and its difficult to get the top up to get TO the bag to change it.,[]
"Otherwise its one hand use is convienent and while closed, no odor.",[]
I would recommend it.,[]
"Prior to buying the diaper champ, we were using a regular old garbage can.",[]
Oh how I wish I hadn't spent the money on this thing!,[]
I change the bags frequently.,[]
I wash it out with soap and water.,[]
I use lysol in between washings.,[]
This thing just reeks!,[]
I gag everytime I have to change the bags.,[]
The smell does not stay inside either.Back to the store I go for a regular old garbage can.,[]
"Terrible, terrible product!",[]
"!BTW, I had to give this product a ""1"" as there is no ""no stars"" option.",[]
I Loved this product.,[]
It kept smell to a minimum and could use a regular size trash bag.,[]
Highly  recommend.,[]
"Love this because you use your own free bags (plastic handle grocery bags are perfect), and it keeps the smell in.You MUST wrap the diaper up with all the wet/dirty inside and diaper tape it closed or the sides of the disposal tube get goo on them and it will get into the workings.",[]
"My husband put one extremely poopy diaper in the wrong way and I had to hose the thing down thoroughly turning the handle back and forth repeatedly to get the inside washed out, but it was mostly fine after that.Take it outside to empty the bag once or twice a week so the stink escapes outside and not in your house and all is well.A one time investment in the diaper champ and no bags to every buy or run out of again...  and no odor (unless you've waited way too long to empty it).",[]
This has been a wonderful diaper pail.,[]
"My daughter is almost two, and we have never had an odor problem.",[]
"We have friends with other diaper pails, and they love ours, also.",[]
"It's SUPER easy to use, and you can use your own trash bags -- no expensive refills to buy.",[]
We use bags we buy in bulk at Costco.,[]
"It uses normal kitchen bags, so it's MUCH CHEAPER than buying refills for those other models.",[]
An EXCELLENT purchase.,[]
"As a first time Mom, I originally registered for the Diaper Genie until VETERAN MOMS RECOMMENDED THE DIAPER CHAMP over and over.",[]
We are thrilled that we listened!1) NO SMELLY ROOMS.,[]
"The cylinder-like disposal action never exposes the inside of the pail to the air, keeping the smell inside.",[]
The one handed operation is super for Moms with their hands full.,[]
"And a bonus **When your child is old enough to walk, they like to be helpful and throw away the diapers themselves.",[]
It is easy enough for them to place the diaper in the tube and turn the handle.,[]
**2) NO CUSTOM BAGS to buy.,[]
"Any regular kitchen bag will do, even giving you the option of using scented bags.",[]
Very economical.3) SIMPLE TO EMPTY.,[]
"Once you get the hang of the latch (slow, steady pressure) just pop open and pull out bag.",[]
"Of course you will smell some when you pull out dirty diapers, but simply seal the bag and take to the trash right away.4) EASY TO CLEAN.",[]
"After emptying the bag, we just spray an air deodorizer (like Oust) inside the pail and wipe down the shaft where we put the diapers in.",[]
It couldn't be easier.5) NEW BAGS ARE A SNAP TO LOAD!,[]
The new bag fits right under a handle inside the pail and secures it well.The only time we encountered a problem was when we let the pail get too full and we couldn't fit in any more diapers.,[]
"The handle didn't turn all the way, letting us know it was overfilled.",[]
We remedied it by emptying the bag.Diaper Champ is a mom-tested product that came to us highly recommended and we feel the same!,[]
Definitely worth purchasing!,[]
This is so much better than the diaper Genie.,[]
Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.,[]
With no special bags.,[]
Love it.,[]
After 2 and half years I still can't get the smell out.,[]
"Its been sitting outside airing out for 3 months now, I think thats where I'm leaving it too.",[]
"I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.",[]
We bought this in desperation because we couldn't figure out how the diaper genie works.,[]
"During a visit with family, my brother-in-law showed us how to use the Genie.",[]
We then put the Diaper Champ in our baby's room and the Genie in the bathroom.There really is an odor problem with the Diaper Champ.,[]
We ended up using the Genie for Dirty Diapers and the Champ for Wet diapers only.I went online to see the reviews and I am amazed to find similar experiences.,[]
Truly Honest reviews.1.,[]
Gives off too much odor2.,[]
Tough to open3.,[]
Takes too much spaceI'm a clean freak and I use Clorox on everything.,[]
The smell disappears for a day but will soon start again once a single dirty diaper stays overnight in the Champ.,[]
"I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).",[]
I love this diaper pail!,[]
My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).,[]
"My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.",[]
The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.,[]
"Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!",[]
This product meets all my expectations.,[]
The diaper champ is easy to put together.,[]
It keeps odors in the container.,[]
Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags!,[]
"By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up.",[]
Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.,[]
"In registering and purchasing products for my baby, I did a lot of research.",[]
"This included reading reviews, asking friends (lots) about products that did and didn't work for them, and actually trying to use some of the products.",[]
I decided to go w/ the Diaper Champ after learning that the overwhelming majority of my friends absolutely hated that leading diaper pail the Diaper Genie and actually trying to use that awful contraption.,[]
In fact in one circle of friends the Diaper Genie was re-gifted about four times b/c they were simply trying to get rid of it.,[]
I also did not like the idea of having to buy the special bags that the Diaper Genie requires.,[]
The diaper champ uses regular kitchen bags.,[]
I have NEVER experienced an odor problem.,[]
If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!,[]
I usually change mine twice a week on garbage day.-You still have to clean the thing!!,[]
I usually spray the inside w/ Lysol when I change the bag and/ or wipe it w/ antibacterial wipes.,[]
On occasion I wipe it w/ cleaner just as I would clean by bathroom.-For those complaining about toddler diaper odors.,[]
"Toddlers eat solids, their poop smell very adult like!",[]
"We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.",[]
I read all the reveiws.,[]
The thing that got me was the person who said the genie was FRUSTRATRING.,[]
My husband and I do not do frustrating.,[]
The champ is brilliant and there is no twisting of a proprietary bag.,[]
I bought regular bags on sale and they work fine in this one handed product.,[]
Drop the diapie and flip the handle.,[]
"Hey, if it stinks, YOU NEED TO TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH MORE OFTEN !!",[]
Get this one....,[]
This is the worst diaper pail ever!,[]
"It was great for the first couple weeks, but then it began to smell.",[]
"I cleaned the inside and outside with 409 again and again, but the smell would return with the first diaper I put in.",[]
Then to make matters worse my 16 month old figured out it was fun to put toys in the hole where you put the diapers and try to flip it the way I did with his dirty diapers.,[]
"I had a Diaper Genie that broke and was hopeful that this less complicated diaper disposal system would work as well, but it does not!",[]
My daughter has been in cloth diapers for 2 years now (yes on outings and trips I have used disposables).,[]
The Champ is great for cloth diapers.,[]
It kept the bad odors out and I could use 5 cent bags to fill it.,[]
"My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.",[]
This has been great for cloth diapers and has a really sturdy base.,[]
It is also easy to use one handed while changing a squirming baby!,[]
"The clasp is hard to open, but if it were any easier, my daughter would be able to open it.",[]
"If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.",[]
"While I like the fact that you can use regular trash bags, I am now on my 2nd Diaper Champ (in 9 months) and it just stinks so bad...AND, we don't even put the smelly diapers in it!!",[]
We clean it every week or so and it still has this nasty odor.,[]
I plan on ditching it and getting something else asap.,[]
Very disappointed in this product.,[]
Awesome contraption.,[]
"I'm a first-time dad, and even a bumbling fool like me loves this thing.",[]
It's like a toy for grown-ups.,[]
"Kinda tough to open, but with a little patience, it's a dream.",[]
Odor-control is adequate enough for my sensitive nose.,[]
We empty it twice a week on garbage night.,[]
"Upon opening, be prepared fopr a blast of smell in your face, but a quick spray of Lysol cures that instantly.",[]
Awesome unit.,[]
"Cheaper than the ""Genie"", and no special bags to buy.",[]
We use drawstring bags from the local wholesale store.,[]
"No fuss, no muss.",[]
"Again, awesome.",[]
We initially had no problems with this product... we were so happy to not be buying expensive trash bags.,[]
"However, after our daughter started eating solid foods and the poop started to have a more powerful odor, the champ was easily KO'd.",[]
"We still use the champ for wet diapers, but ended up buying the diaper genie for smelly ones... so we still get the benefit of cheap plastic bags for most of our diapers, but get the smell protection of the genie.",[]
Thank the lord for whomever designed this fabulous thing!,[]
I did lots of research when registering and went with this because of friends telling me how they hated the Diaper Genie.,[]
I LOVE IT!!,[]
It is SO easy to use and keep clean.,[]
It doesn't let one stinky odor creep into the baby's room.,[]
"You'll get some odor when you open it to change it but come on, there are poopy diapers in there!!",[]
How do you expect it to smell?!,[]
It takes tall kitchen garbage bags that we already use so there is no added cost to use this.,[]
We only empty it twice a week.,[]
I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!,[]
!,[]
I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers.,[]
My cat box smells fresher!,[]
"So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys!",[]
"Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too.",[]
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.,[]
"So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door.",[]
"Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!",[]
Works great!,[]
NO smells and holds lot of diapers.,[]
Uses standard kitchen bags!,[]
What a great product!,[]
So far we love our Diaper Champ.,[]
We have been using it for 3 months and have had no problem with smells.,[]
We liked the fact that you could use regular trash bags instead of special refills.,[]
This is my first baby so I have nothing to compare this product to.,[]
But I have heard horror stories of stinky diaper pails.,[]
My baby is now six months old and the only time I smell her diapers is when I change them and when I open the pail to replace the bag!,[]
I use the same garbage bags that I use in my 13-gallon kitchen trash can!,[]
It's so simple and user-friendly it's ridiculous!,[]
"Put in a trash bag, old plastic grocery bag, yard waste bag, whatever; put down the top, you're ready to go.",[]
The top acts like a chute and whisks the dirty diaper away.,[]
"When full pop the top (hold your breath), pull out the bag and put in a new one.",[]
No jamming or any other kind of technical difficulty whatsoever!,[]
"And, again, no leaking smells.",[]
Don't waste your money on anything else!,[]
"As new parents, we started out with the Diaper Genie because everyone told us that we just *HAD* to have one.",[]
While the Genie did a decent job at keeping the odors inside (except when emptying it!,[]
"), it was a pain in the neck for older family members to use (e.g.",[]
grandparents) and those refill cartridges start to add up after a while!A friend with a child the same age as mine showed me her Diaper Champ and I was thoroughly impressed!,[]
"Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.",[]
We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he'd be in diapers for at least another year so we'd be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.,[]
"Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!",[]
"After all, we're already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?",[]
"!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.",[]
It is super easy to empty it too.,[]
"And I've found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!",[]
"And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!",[]
"We bought this one for several reasons: cheaper, uses garbage bags, easier to use.",[]
We've used it for 6 months now and haven't had any regrets.,[]
"Regardless of what you have, once your baby starts on solids the odor changes and it really doesn't matter what you put it in- it will stink to some degree.",[]
Our friends have the Diaper Genie and it's terrible!,[]
(Smells BAD and what a pain to change) The Champ does still stink a bit (although not horribly) AND it is a breeze to change out.,[]
Just what you want when you're cleaning up the diapers- quick.,[]
It uses reg.,[]
"trash bags, which is sooo much easier.",[]
"We keep ours in the laundry room (down the hall from her room) and, honestly, it's worth it to walk a little ways than to have her room stink.",[]
It certainly does the job.,[]
"Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.",[]
Highly recommended.,[]
I bought this product after reading a lot about it and reading the reviews.,[]
"My daughter is turning 1 this month, I tried to make it work all this time, and finally had to give in and buy the Diaper Genie.",[]
"I could no longer stand the smell in my baby's room, it was terrible!!!",[]
"I like the fact that one could use 1 hand and also that it's larger than the other pails, but the smell was unbearable!!!!",[]
"And, YES I did clean it at least once a week and always used Lysol when changing/emptying the bag.",[]
I have had the Diaper Genie only for a couple of weeks and the bad smell is gone from my baby's room!!!!,[]
=0),[]
We've used this diaper pail for 16 months now and smell never escapes from it (except when we open it to change the bag).,[]
"We use plastic trash bags from Target, we pay I think $4 for 100 bags.",[]
It's a deal and works great.,[]
I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.,[]
I registered for and received a diaper genie at my baby shower.,[]
Everyone I spoke to said that this was one thing that a mom couldn't be without.,[]
I found the diaper genie difficult to load and use.,[]
"While in Babies R Us one day, in the mother's room, they had the diaper champ for use and what a difference it made!",[]
"No special bags, easy one handed use.",[]
It was just what I was looking for.,[]
"It doesn't completely shut out odor, but then again, neither did the diaper genie.",[]
It was the best second purchase I ever made.,[]
We have two diaper champs in our house because they are great.,[]
They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.,[]
"It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).",[]
I do recommend wiping it off every so often to keep it fresh.,[]
"i find the champ very useful, no smells till now..my baby is 3 months old and we use a scented disposable bag as a liner and initially i used to put her diapers in a shopping bag and put it in the champ but that was taking space and less diapers were going into the champ so now i throw in the diapers directly into the chanp and there is no mess no smell...","[('diapers', 0.17197540517039187)]"
We received the Diaper Champ as a baby shower gift and we couldn't have asked for a more helpful item!,[]
"Some people complain about the odor, if you wipe it out with antibacterial wipes (as I would do with ANY diaper disposal system)it doesn't stink.",[]
"If the device begins to jam, just change the bag and you're good to go again.",[]
The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a little tough to open sometimes.,[]
"However, if it keeps the diaper odors out of my house, then I will glady wrestle with it a little....overall very good product!",[]
The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!,[]
I do not have any problems with odor because it traps the smell and it is very easy to use.,[]
It uses regular kitchen trash bags which are less expensive than the bags that some of the other diaper pails require.,[]
i refused to buy the genie for the simple reason of i didnt want to be bothered with refills and i read that it clogged.,[]
so i decided on this one and glad i did.,[]
it is most excellent at keeping the foulest of stenches out.,[]
and i love that i dont have to buy those EXPENSIVE refills.,[]
just use the bags you have in your kitchen!,[]
easy to replace when full and it just works!!,[]
!,[]
This is an awesome disposal system because it requires no special bags.,[]
Use whatever type you like; for disposables we use scented trash bags.,[]
"As for the smell complaints, if you empty it regualarly there should be no problem.",[]
"If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.",[]
Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.,[]
"We also used this for our cloth diapers to ""hold"" them until they were ready to be washed.",[]
"Great product, no smelly trouble here.",[]
(Until it's opened up at least),[]
"Finally, a diaper pail without the odor.",[]
The Diaper Champ is the best diaper pail out there and we have tried several.,[]
"It seals the contents well so no ""fumes"" escape.",[]
It also accepts all garbage bags.,[]
My son also thinks it is a fun game to switch the handle over and watch the diaper disappear.,[]
We are so happy with this purchase!,[]
This is the greatest diaper pail!,[]
I highly recommend it.,[]
"Much better than the diaper genie, it is worth the few extra dollars.",[]
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.,[]
Virtually odor free!,[]
"We were researching diaper pails extensively for our twins, and we came to the conclusion that the Champ was the best...My daughter (now 2.5) is now potty trained, but with her diapers we used a regular garbage pail.",[]
"The odor was so unbearable, and so gross that we actually wound up potty training her at 18 months so the smell would be gone!",[]
"With our now 7 month old twins, we use the diaper champ...The PROS*  NO REFILS... We aren't cheap people, nor are we on a very tight budget, but SPENDING money to throw away an already expensive baby product seemed so ridiculous.",[]
"So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?",[]
"NO...*  The champ is TOO DIFICULT to open, which is a major plus in this way, the kiddos cant open it either!",[]
"I cant tell you how many stories I hear of toddlers opening the diaper genie, decor, whatever and ending up with ""diaper sausages"" or a filthy mess all over the nursery... you can be sure that you wont be one of those people if you purchase the champ*  It holds a significantly larger amount of diapers at once, not wasting bags, or making usable space unusable...*  The smell is not too pungent if you follow some tips below...TIPS*  Before your baby starts on solids, dispose the diapers by wrapping them tightly into a ball (using the little straps) and empty them into the pail.","[('empty', 0.06097556761734289)]"
"Change the garbage bag (any bag will work actually) maybe once a week, or more depending on your baby.",[]
"Wash out the pail every so often, and you may even want to spray it with Lysol occasionally.",[]
"*  Once your baby starts solids, bring out the tricks.",[]
"First, when you have a stinky diaper, wrap it up inside itself as best as you can, and if needed place it in a grocery bag, or a Ziploc bag and empty it into the pail.",[]
"****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.",[]
"Empty the pail at least twice a week, or obviously when you start smelling an odor, DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE ODOR IS UNBEARABLE, AS SOON AS AN ODOR IS SMELLED WITH THE PAIL CLOSED, CHANGE THE BAG AND CLEAN!",[]
"When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.",[]
"For extra protection against the smells, use scented garbage bags.",[]
"*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.",[]
"*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?",[]
"Because the Champ takes TWO HANDS to open, and you want to place the diaper in semi-correctly, so the pail works the next time.All in all I find that the Champ is the perfect midway between garbage pails, and diaper genie in the act of disposing diapers... Its not too costly, yet it actually works... A great item that I plan to use for a long time.","[('champ', 0.13482808998699014)]"
"great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...",[]
I found this pail to be heavy without anything in it.,[]
I found that it took up too much space.,[]
I find myself using a regular small garbage pail and I don't smell any odors (and all of my windows are closed).,[]
"dislike the mechanism for opening this pail, when I opened this pail for the first time, I broke two of my nails, I tried opening again and it was still hard on the fingers and nails.",[]
"My son is only two months and perhaps I need a diaper pail later on, but for right now, I am going to use a regular garbage pail.",[]
"After reading in a few books that the Diaper Champ was good, we registered for it and received it.",[]
"Let me tell you, it is better than good.",[]
We have been using it for over 7 months now and there is absolutely no odor in our daughter's room.,[]
I also love that we can use regular kitchen garbage bags.,[]
I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!,[]
!,[]
"When I found out I was pregnant, I ran right out and bought a Diaper Genie.",[]
"However, after reading online reviews, the Diaper Champ seemed to receive better reviews...so, I exchanged my Diaper Genie for a Diaper Champ.",[]
"Boy, am I glad I did!!",[]
No special refills to buy (I use plain old  13 gal.,[]
"kitchen bags), and changing the bag is so easy!",[]
"Easy to use, and I have had no trouble whatsoever with the Diaper Champ smelling at all!",[]
I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!,[]
!,[]
My daughter is 18 months old and we have been using the Diaper Champ her whole life.,[]
I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
It is cheap (no refills) and DOES NOT smell (unless you neglect to take out the bag for long periods of time).,[]
I love this product so much I have recommended it to many others...I actually have bought 2 more as baby shower gifts.,[]
Both mothers I bought the Diaper Champ for love it too.,[]
"Great, great, great diaper pail.",[]
You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.,[]
This diaper pail is one of he best gifts we received!,[]
It's so easy to use and there are no additonal costs for refill bags because you can use just about any size bag you have!,[]
"It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.",[]
It keeps baby's room odor free too!,[]
It's the best diaper disposal out there!,[]
As a first time parent I highly recommend this!,[]
Love the Diaper Champ!,[]
"Currently baby is almost 3 months old and have had to empty twice a week so far, because its full not because it stinks.",[]
No odor problems what so ever.,[]
"Is a tad hard to open at first, but you will get the hang of it.",[]
Got a huge box of trash bags from Costco and keep them in baby's closet.,[]
Love that you don't need special bags and it's easy to use!,[]
I threw away my Diaper Genie.,[]
It was too complicated to change the bags and it filled up very quickly.,[]
We decided on the Diaper Champ after several people in the store recommended it.,[]
I buy the Glad scented trash bags to line the pale and I also buy the small scented Sassy bags to wrap all poopy diapers.,[]
"It may be an overkill, but the nursery does not stink.",[]
My baby is 13 weeks and I change the bag about every 3 days.,[]
* What's not to like -- you use you're own bags.,[]
You already have those!,[]
* Putting the diapers in is as easy as setting it down and then pulling the handle over.,[]
"* There will eventually be an odor around the pail, but that's easily taken care of with a Stick-Up.",[]
* We like it so much that we have 2 -- 1 for our room and 1 for baby's.,[]
Can't get the smell of rank diapers out of the top(cover) of the Diaper Champ.,[]
Any better models out there?,[]
"After about a week, I am convinced, this is the worse diaper pail I've ever bought.",[]
This diaper champ does not contain the odor from my baby's diapers even for one day.,[]
"And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.",[]
Who has time to do all that?,[]
What a disappointment!,[]
!,[]
I reccomend the diaper champ.,[]
We used it for along time.,[]
"You don't have to have special bags, just plain ole tall kitchen garbage bags.",[]
I actually passed it on to a family member.,[]
It is very sturdy and easy to operate.,[]
I love these pails so much that we have two of them doing diaper duty!!,[]
"It's odorless, effortless, and holds many diapers!",[]
I also like the fact that you do not have to buy special bags for it and can use ordinary trash bags.,[]
A great invention!,[]
!,[]
We love this product!!!,[]
"Our son is 3 months old now, and we have used this from day one.",[]
Breast milk diapers and formula diapers...this gem contains all the odors!!,[]
"It's incredibly easy to use, and when it starts to get hard to get the diapers in, that's a sign it's time to change the bag.",[]
"They only smell is when you need to change the bag, and that's brief.",[]
"I did put a ""stick-up"" air freshener in the bottom of the ""Champ"" for added ""protection"" when I change the bag.",[]
"We have absolutely NO complaints about the Diaper Champ, and my friends with the Diaper Genie are completely jealous!",[]
GET THIS PRODUCT!!,[]
You will not regret it!!,[]
!,[]
Our son is 10 months old now and we finally had to toss the Champ.,[]
We originally bought it because we could use our own trash bags.,[]
"We figured by changing it frequently, it would keep the odor away.",[]
"But once our son started with the solids, we couldn't take it anymore.",[]
This unit is difficult to keep clean.,[]
"If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.",[]
My husband and I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
"It holds a nice amount of diapers,contains the odor and it uses your own garbage bags.",[]
"The Diaper Champ is easy to use and to empty, it really is a wonderfully designed product.",[]
We love the diaper champ.,[]
"We were not excited about the idea of buying special bags just to toss diapers into, but wanted the odor locking power of the diaper genie.",[]
We were thrilled when we saw the diaper champ and even more thrilled once we began to use it.,[]
It is simple to use and eliminates diaper odors.,[]
It is easy to clean as well.,[]
Keeping it clean with daily bag emptying and occaisonal lysol spray will keep it oderless.,[]
"Once our baby, now 4 months old, is able to get into things he won't beable to get into this trash can since the diaper champ ""locks"" securely closed.",[]
"Any plastic bag works, but the tall kitchen trash bags work very well.",[]
"And, since it takes regular bags you will not feel guilty about using it as a secure trash can for all of baby's room trash.",[]
The diaper champ could be a little better.,[]
My husband and I just had our first child and wanted something that would cut down on smell *which it does and when we noticed that it used any bag we were sold.,[]
.,[]
.,[]
it wasn't until a couple days after our daughter was home that we noticed a problem .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
a major jam!!!,[]
If you don't tightly fold the diapers they will jam and it's more of a pain to deal with then any smell.,[]
.,[]
.,[]
I don't need to have my hands in any more diapers then I already am dealing with ya know what I mean?!?,[]
I hope it works as my daughter gets bigger =) I do like the product expect for the jams and the loud noise,[]
"I do like the fact that you don't have to buy special refill bags for it, but the Diaper Champ definitely does not control the smell of the diapers.",[]
"I do change and clean it frequently, but still notice that my son's room still seems to smell of dirty diapers.",[]
"I have tried the diaper genie as well, and we didn't like that one either.",[]
I also find the Diaper Champ pretty unsightly.,[]
"If I had to do it again, I would just get a regular garbage can with a lid and change it daily.",[]
I think it would contain the smell as well as the Diaper Champ.,[]
I bought this pail before my son was born.,[]
"First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail, but it was broken, and the store was out of stock when we returned it.",[]
I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use.,[]
My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all.,[]
"Now that we have this one, he loves it.",[]
It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper.,[]
No twisting till your wrist breaks.,[]
"At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well.",[]
I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags.,[]
My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers.,[]
The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail.,[]
All in all it's been a great buy.,[]
We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment.,[]
the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder!,[]
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).,[]
I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!,[]
I purchased this after seeing it at a show for new baby items.,[]
"With a 2 year old that wasn't yet potty-trained and another on the way, I wanted a diaper disposal system in each of my boys' rooms.",[]
I had this one in my two-year old's room and it was horrible.,[]
I thought that not having to purchase separate bags would be wonderful.,[]
I even bought those garbage bags with the odor removal in them and it still didn't work.,[]
My sons' room smelled terrible after about a week.,[]
No amount of cleaning the unit helped.,[]
"At least with the Diaper Genie, you seal off the bag and there is a seal when you close the lid.",[]
Not with this system.,[]
"It is easier to use, but the smell is awful.",[]
You might as well just put the diaper in a pail and remove it daily.,[]
"Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.",[]
I started out with the Diaper Genie.,[]
"After nothing but fustrating attempts to use it, I threw it away.",[]
The Diaper Champ came to the rescue.,[]
I wonder now why I attempted to use the other one for so long.,[]
The Diaper Champ is so handy and easy to use.,[]
You can dispose of dirty diaper with one hand.,[]
"It is easy to take apart and clean, unlike the competition.",[]
"No more spending money on ""their"" products for bags.",[]
The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.,[]
To insert and remove the bag is simply.,[]
This is definitely a must have product.,[]
I was told not to waste my money on a diaper pail because it didn't do what it claimed to do.,[]
Finding out it was a genie diaper pail I read the reviews of the diaper champ and decided to try the champ.,[]
I couldn't have spent my money any wiser.,[]
Their is never an odor and I always wait until it is completely full.,[]
Convenience of not buying new bags is wonderful!!,[]
This is great for my 10 week baby's room-Love it!!!!!,[]
!,[]
I am using the Daiper Champ for the disposal of my colostomy bags.,[]
It has saved me many trips outside to the garbage can.,[]
Now I only need to empty it once a week.,[]
There is very little smell.,[]
Of course there is more smell when you open it to change the bag.,[]
I am considering putting in a toilet deoderizer for this purpose.,[]
I am very happy with this product.,[]
I LOVE this product and so does my husband!!,[]
My friends have the Diaper Genie and I have never been able to figure out how to use it so when I did my registry I was smart.,[]
"The Champ doesnt require special bags, its easy to use and empty and there is never a smell.",[]
I think this product is economical and mom and dad friendly!!,[]
Oh it doesnt take up much space either!,[]
!16 month old update.,[]
"Still love the ease of the Champ but it does have some odor now ecspecially after a stinky diaper, the whole room smells sometimes.",[]
You have to be good about cleaning it everytime you change the bag.,[]
I would maybe consider another kind for next baby.,[]
We have used the Diaper Champ for a year now.,[]
It was fantastic at the beginning of our daughter's life.,[]
"It held smells well, it was easy to use, empty, and clean.",[]
"Now that her diet has changed to the same foods we eat, her diapers are pretty stinky.",[]
"The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.",[]
The odor coming from her room after even 1 diaper is awful.,[]
We are constantly buring candles in her room to help and we have even started bagging the diapers in plastic baggies before we deposit them in the Diaper Champ.,[]
Nothing seems to help.,[]
"We change this at least 1x a week, if not 2x and it still stinks.",[]
Loved this for the first six months.,[]
I used tall kitchen bags with odor neutralizing patches and the Champ worked like a charm.,[]
Until...I found a piece of old foam hanging from the drum.,[]
"This was the ""liner"" and after it fell out the Champ was SMELLY.",[]
I called customer service and they were nice and not the least bit surprised that the liner had worn out after only six months.,[]
"They promptly sent a replacement and explained how to take the ""drum"" apart so I could attach the new liner.",[]
Much easier said than done.,[]
"Took a full very frustrating hour and once I'd pried the blue knobs off, they were never the same.",[]
The knobs would no longer stay attached to the drum and every time one fell off out would come stinky diaper smell.,[]
"I called the company again and they were nice enough and sent replacement knobs but the Champ is not the same; plus, customer service said the liner has to be replaced every six months.",[]
What a drag.,[]
I can't imagine that six months from now I'm going to want go through the whole thing again.,[]
The concept is good but the design is flawed.,[]
The Diaper Champ was one of the first items on my baby registry based on reviews.,[]
"Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!",[]
!2) True one hand operation (use the other one to hold down son)3) Hardly any smell.,[]
"I am realistic, baby poop and pee is going to smell.",[]
To help curb that we put a box of baking soda at the bottom.,[]
"We change the bag about once a week - and yes, it really smells when you change the bag, but again - it's a weeks worth of poop and pee!4) I have heard that as kids get older the fun of turning the handle might prompt them to test it out with non-trash items.","[('bag', 0.13287042319931902)]"
I'll have to wait and see and hope that I can teach my son it isn't a toy5) My friend got a newer model that has a wider and heavier tumbler.,[]
"It is easier to use, but I am not running out to replace mine.",[]
I received as a gift the diaper Champ.,[]
Boy what a gift!,[]
my friends though they where being practical not having to buy cassettes that was a mistake.,[]
The smell that filled the nursery was just horrible.,[]
I will be shopping for a new daper pail.,[]
My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.,[]
"Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.",[]
Presto!,[]
Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.,[]
"But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.",[]
(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.,[]
"Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?)",[]
"So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.","[('friend', 0.07724687716933615)]"
Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.,[]
Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.,[]
I have three children.,[]
For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.,[]
I would not recommend buying that one.,[]
My second child I didn't get any.,[]
Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.,[]
I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.,[]
I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.,[]
I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.,[]
It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.,[]
I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.,[]
This is the greatest...I had one of the OTHER highly recommended diaper pails with my 1st child and it stunk up the whole house!,[]
But with the diaper champ we have had NO odors at all!,[]
This is wonderful...and being able to use any trash bag is a plus also!,[]
I would highly recommend this to anyone!,[]
I have the original Diaper Champ and this one.,[]
The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!,[]
The bottom is wider than the top so the diapers fill up the wider spot at the bottom making it hard to pull the bag out of the top.,[]
What a horrible design!,[]
Poop smells bad.,[]
"It's why we don't call it ""potpourri"" instead of ""poop"".",[]
Contained poop stored for a week smells REALLY bad.,[]
"So, empty the champ every other day, let it air out while you carry the bag to the garage, and then put in another scented garbage bag and just be happy you didn't have to make an emergency run to the store for silly diaper genie bags.If a whiff of dirty diapers as you empty the pail has you fainting, then by all means, you should be warned...worse stuff than this is gonna happen before your kid reaches 18.I love my champ, and since even I was too squeamish for cloth diapers, at least I feel better knowing I'm not having to gift wrap every single dirty diaper.The champ may not smell like roses all the time, but frankly, neither does your baby.Maintaining the champ is not as easy as flushing a toilet, but really, what in life is?","[('champ', 0.08778974363492248)]"
"It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.",[]
We have used ours for a year now.,[]
And its an overall good product.,[]
"But when your baby starts eating solids at about 6mth, the poopy diapers get really stinky and even the diaper champ cannot stop these nasty smells from seeping out.",[]
We now have a carbon filtered fan to get rid on the smell of dirty diapers in addition to the diaper champ.,[]
The concept is good.,[]
"So far, at three and a half months, his s_ _ _ _ doesn't stink.",[]
"The problem is, even though his diaper size is only ""1"", it clogs the chute.",[]
"Even with the bag freshly changed, I have to open it up, and, from the inside, pull it through.",[]
No fun in the middle of the night.,[]
"If the chute were widern diameter, it may be a hit.",[]
Simply save the plastic bags from grocery shopping and be sure to empty your garbage everyday.,[]
WAHLAH!I have the diaper champ-but really it fits like three diapers then  I have to change the bag.,[]
I've just resorted to the grocery bag method.,[]
Bought this after my friend got one for her shower and loved it for a while.,[]
"It is taller, holds more diapers, no special bags all those are great things but the smell does not disappear no matter how much you clean it and spray it with Lysol.",[]
BUT I used the Diaper Genie for 3 years as well and it has the same problem with the smell and still does not have the other benefits.,[]
There is not a perfect solution that I have found other than just hauling the diapers out daily to the outside trash can!,[]
"It's been several years since we had a baby, with my other kids we just used a regular trash can with lid for the diapers.",[]
"It was okay, but stunk to high heaven when opened.",[]
"This time around, I decided to register for the Diaper Champ because I liked the idea of not being committed to buying refills like the Genie and could use regular trash bags.",[]
"I got the Champ for a gift, and find it so easy and fun to use.",[]
My other kids enjoy helping dispose of the diapers too!,[]
I don't notice any problems with odor at all.,[]
"It takes a couple days to fill up, I do have to ""shake down"" the can so that I can cram more diapers in.",[]
You can tell it's getting full when the diapers don't fall into it easily.,[]
I wouldn't call it odorless.,[]
We only change ours once a week though since we have another one downstairs - so what can you expect?,[]
"Otherwise, we love it.",[]
"Super easy to use, no refills!",[]
!,[]
"This product does what it says it does, and at a price far better than its competitors.The only problem we have encountered has to do with the tabs of velcro-style diaper closures sticking to the mesh fabric found inside the rotating portion of the product.",[]
"On a few occasions, the velcro bits stick to the liner, and make it difficult to fully rotate the drum and to eject the dirty diaper into the bag below.",[]
I had to take the rotating drum apart and peel off a portion of the mesh fabric liner so that it didn't repeatedly snag diapers going through the tube.,[]
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.,[]
Removing the mesh liner did not effect the stink-resistance in any way...,[]
I love this product.,[]
"It's easy to use, there is no odor, and it uses regular trash bags instead of expensive refills.",[]
"You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.",[]
"It is a little stiff to open, however, this is a good thing when your child is old enough to open it themselves.",[]
I thought I had researched all the diaper pails that were out there.,[]
"I previously owned a Diaper Genie, and hated the thought of having buy the refills.",[]
So I invested in the Diaper Champ and that thing stinks so much!!!,[]
"The Diaper Genie only smelled when I was changing the refill, but the CHAMP stinks my boys room up..",[]
I have tried everything from a stick-um to deodorized bags and nothings helps the smell from getting out..,[]
I have a 2 yr old and a 4 month old and that room gets really Smelly...,[]
I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!,[]
!,[]
When we first got the Diaper Champ we really liked it.,[]
Especially since we didn't need to buy special bags for it.,[]
We have had it for almost 18 months now and the smell is horrible.,[]
"We have tried bleach, comet, scrubbing and soaking and the smell just won't come out.",[]
It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.,[]
I love my diaper champ.,[]
My husband and I love the fact that you can just use regualr trash bags.,[]
I have even used Wal-Mart bags in a pinch.,[]
It fits about 15-20 diapers.,[]
For all those people complaining that it jams and smells...fold the diaper and use a little spray of Lysol when changing the bag.,[]
The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.,[]
"I also have a friend with an older child, her son is able to flip the lid after he is changed.",[]
So if a 2 year old can do it it is easy!,[]
!,[]
"This is easy to use, but it does not disguise the smell that great!",[]
I did like that you can use any kind of bag with it.,[]
"With my second child I wanted something better than the Diaper Genie which I did not like at all, it was smelly and impossible to do with a one hand action.",[]
Enter the Diaper Champ!,[]
After reading all of the customer reviews here I decided to try it and everyone was so right.,[]
I can put poopie diapers in this diaper pail and it doesn't smell at all!,[]
"It holds a sufficient amount of diapers and needs no special bags, just regular garbage bags.",[]
I has an easy one hand action to deposit the dirty diapers leaving one hand free to hold the baby with.,[]
"I am totally pleased with the Diaper Champ and hope everyone gives it a try, its worth the money!",[]
Two years ago we bought the diaper champ because we thought it looked like it would keep the odor down and didn't require refills - and we loved it.,[]
After two years it had absorbed enough odor that we wanted to replace it so we bought a new one.,[]
"They changed their design and their ""new and improved"" diaper champ stinks the whole house up after less than a month!Stay away from this - they've ruined their own product!",[]
This pale is all that I could have asked for.,[]
"It holds 3-4 days worth of diapers, doesn't need refills- a garbarge bag or even a large babies r us plastic bag (sorry guys!!!",[]
)will do and best of all it does not release any odors.,[]
"So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.",[]
"We registered for and received the Diaper Champ, and we are VERY pleased with it.",[]
"It is so easy to use, even at 3 am with a crying wiggly baby on the changing table.",[]
"It's neat, it's clean, it doesn't require expensive refill bags....  it simply cannot be beat.",[]
HIGHLY recommended!,[]
"Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!",[]
I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.,[]
That was all I could take.,[]
"Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.",[]
Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE's changing room is the Diaper Champ.,[]
"It was easy, didn't smell, and used regular trash bags.",[]
"I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.",[]
"Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).",[]
"Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).",[]
"Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter's room doesn't smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.",[]
"You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.",[]
It is fantastic!,[]
!,[]
We've been using this diaper pail for two and a half years.,[]
It stinks.,[]
"We decided to put it in the garage and just toss the diapers in the kitchen garbage, as it was getting taken out more frequently.",[]
"I got tired of taking diapers into the kitchen though, and brought it back inside.",[]
"After two days of using it again (with an air freshener in the bottom, my daughter's room stunk again.",[]
"Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.",[]
Then you find yourself pulling gross wipes out just to get the thing to flip over and sometimes you have to open it to pull them out.,[]
Opening it releases a nasty odor into the room which lingers for hours.,[]
I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.,[]
ODERLESS!!,[]
HAHAHA!!,[]
The smells that comes from it is no more or less than any other pails.,[]
I am very ver disappointed with the product.,[]
"If you want a good oderless pail, I heard to go with metal garbage cans.",[]
You pay the same price and the diaper smell does not get sucked into the plastic.Good luck with your hunt:0),[]
This is amazing!,[]
We can toss tons of diapers (abouth 5 days diapers for a new born).,[]
And there is NO smell at all.,[]
"I do recommend the following: Close well each diaper with the velcro, you'll be able to fit more diappers.",[]
"And occasionally clean the tube where the diaper is toss with baby wipes, then toss the wipe.",[]
"Somehow when you open the diaper champ to replace teh bag, you smell more wipes than stools!",[]
I had a diaper genie on my registry and I didn't get it.,[]
"Right before I had my baby, I went to the store to buy a few things that I needed on my registry.",[]
"I ended up getting the diaper champ because you don't need any bags, and it looked really easy.",[]
It has worked out great.,[]
"We have had no problem with smell, we've used it for 6 months, and we take it out once to twice a week.",[]
"I tell all expecting and new parents about it, it's great!",[]
I bought this diaper pail for two reasons.,[]
The first reason is because this brand was used when I worked at a daycare.,[]
"I figured if it can keep smelly diapers contained from 20 children, it can surely keep my son's room smelling good.",[]
The second reason I bought it is because I could use regular trash bags instead of having to buy the expensive Diaper Genie bags.My son is 4 months old now and this was one of the best purchases ever made.,[]
It's easy to use with only one hand and it keeps the nasty smell in the pail and out of the room.,[]
I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.,[]
I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone.,[]
I LOVED this little champ!,[]
"My youngest is 2.5 now and so we don't use it anymore, but it cut down on odor almost completely.",[]
"I had the after baby nose and could detect even the smallest of odors, but no one else could smell a thing!",[]
I used a different disposal system with my oldest and got rid of it almost immediately.,[]
I was better off just taking it into the kitchen and putting in a garbage can under the sink.,[]
"It disguised the smell just as much, but the champ worked GREAT!After my youngest outgrew it, it became the trash can for the cat and her litter and it works just as good for her!",[]
I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.,[]
"However if you are really careful, or maybe even just more coordinated than myself, it isn't a problem at all.",[]
This product is great!,[]
It's simple to assemble and use.,[]
There are no cartriges to buy and no odor leaks.,[]
We're very impressed.,[]
We wanted to have a convenient locking receptable for poop-laden diapers in our toddler's bedroom.,[]
"While they do lock, they aren't convenient.",[]
Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table.,[]
"Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.",[]
"They're bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of.",[]
"We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.",[]
"What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.",[]
"You'd need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change.",[]
"It will control odors better, and you won't have to be continually wiping poop off the outside of it.",[]
Compared to the Genie this thing is awesome!,[]
"When Genie refills neared $6 each, I dumped both Genies in the trash and bought one of these.",[]
I've never had problems with odor but then again I change my bag frequently (have to with a 2 year old and a 5 month old).,[]
I can't say enough about this diaper pail.,[]
I've told all my friends that are moms or expecting about it.,[]
"I used the genie for two years and pregnant with my second child, I read the reviews of the champ and was excited.",[]
"After two years, the plastic of the genie soaked in the smells.",[]
"With the champ, I was very disappointed because after two days, I need to change the champ or it will smell up the house.",[]
I could leave diapers in the genie for up to 7 days before changing it out.,[]
I only use the genie/champ for poopy diapers.,[]
Maybe mine is defective...I'll never know.,[]
I am going to sell my champ on e-bay and buy another genie.,[]
"The fillers with the genie are a pain, but worth it.",[]
We read so many reviews before registering for this item.,[]
We love it.,[]
It's easy to use and we don't notice any smells at all.,[]
"We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.",[]
"If you do notice a smell, try throwing a dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail.",[]
"Per sonally, I feel very comfortable recommending this item.",[]
"In fact we're buying a second one for downstairs, to avail the ""long walk"".",[]
:-) Good Luck!,[]
We bought this when my daughter was born 2 yrs ago and we loved it.,[]
"Easy to use, no special bags needed..oh, we couldn't complain about it, but all of a sudden it started to smell.",[]
I'd say when she started eating more and more solids(around 6-8 mos) we had to retire the Diaper Champ.,[]
We bought small trash bags on purpose just so we would change the bag each night and no help.,[]
"Every weekend I took the Champ out on the deck and washed it with water and vinegar, then water and bleach and after leaving it out for the night it was fine..for 2-3 days, then it smelled again.",[]
"After a while I was starting to believe the actual Champ was stincky, so anyways it finally retired in our garage waiting for the next baby to come along.",[]
"Like I said, we were very happy with it for a few months.",[]
It's very easy to use and if you can figure out a way to keep the smell out you'll love it.,[]
Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.,[]
Works well and very cheap at the same time.,[]
"Overall this is a smart invention - no cartridges that need replacing, easy, and you can just use a kitchen bag.",[]
It's smart.,[]
"Just a warning though, make sure the diaper is very securely closed when putting it in the container.",[]
I put a dirty one in that came unraveled and got into the turning mechanism.,[]
"Needless to say, it took a while to clean it and now I have leftover poo trapped in the sides.",[]
I've tried many ways to clean it with no success.,[]
I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.,[]
The lesson - simpler is better....,[]
I love this item!,[]
"Any diaper system is gonna smell sometime, we now change now change this 2-3 times a week to keep the smell down and so far it works.",[]
We have been using this for over a year and the money we saved in refills has helped out a LOT!,[]
I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!,[]
Plus they can get expensive when you're having to change your baby 8 times a day and you have to buy refills for it.,[]
"When I first saw the Diaper Champ and read what you needed for it and what it did, there was no question that I wanted it!",[]
It's awesome!,[]
"When they say it's odorless, it REALLY is.",[]
The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.,[]
You never smell anything when it's closed.,[]
"Plus, I like the fact that you don't have to buy refill bags for it.",[]
It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.,[]
I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a very convenient and odorless diaper pail!,[]
I've been using my Diaper Champ for over 3 years now.,[]
I've used the Diaper Champ for size Newborn on up through Pull-Ups.,[]
"And while I've vowed to never give a child in diapers fish sticks ever again, I can say that this diaper pail is up to even that olfactory challenge.",[]
This pail does a decent job of containing odors.,[]
Yes - if you haven't emptied it recently you will smell diaper smell when you flip the handle.,[]
That's usually my cue.,[]
When I smell anything the pail must be almost full and time to make a bag change.My guess is that the Genie contains odors better.,[]
But when you've got 2 or more sick kids - or even 1 healthy kid - who has time to get to the store for special bags?,[]
The Diaper Champ uses the same size bag as the pail in most kitchens.I did not give this product a 5 because it does drive me nuts to open the lid to get the bag out.,[]
Sometimes the lid opens smoothly and sometimes it sticks and requires major wrestling.,[]
I received this as a baby gift and it works great.,[]
"I have not noticed any smells, and my baby has had some pretty smelly diapers.",[]
It holds more diapers than some of the other diaper pails and has the greatest advantage-- no expensive refill bags.,[]
It uses regular trash bags.,[]
I suggest buying scented trash bags to even greatly decrease the chance of smells.,[]
"It is a little tricky to open, but once you figure out how it's not bad.",[]
Just push down on the lever rather than trying to pull up.,[]
I love the Diaper Champ...you don't have the need for expensive refills and there is very little odor.,[]
The main odor is revealed when it is time to change the bag.,[]
You almost want to change the bag outside!,[]
"I find that if I keep a small air freshener in the bottom, it does help...(like one for a car).",[]
"So easy to use, definitely recommend!!",[]
!,[]
I checked out all of the available diaper disposal systems.,[]
"This by far is the best, no refillable special bags, no stink, and very easy to use.",[]
It is great!,[]
Those exploding diapers for newborns can't even crack this.,[]
I bought this diaper pail to go in our room while my son is rooming in...and so far it's been a lifesaver.,[]
"First of all, their is no smell whatsoever from the pail...only time their is a slight smell is when  you open it to empty the bags.",[]
But I keep it near my side of the bed with his other diaper supplies and I don't smell a thing.,[]
"Second of all, I can operate it with one hand...including opening it.",[]
So maybe I just got lucky but I've had no problems with it whatsoever.,[]
I change out my bag once a week and I spray it with lysol every time I change it and let it airdry.,[]
With those lil' steps I've been able to keep both my room and my home diaper smell free :O)~~ This pail works better then those I've had that cost almost twice as much.,[]
It really is a diaper champ !,[]
This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.,[]
I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.,[]
No complaints at all!,[]
"Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!",[]
"As both a money saver and time saver, this is the diaper pail to have!",[]
"It doesn't require any special bags to buy, other than regular trash bags, and only needs 1 hand to operate.",[]
You can be holding baby and still secure the diaper in the pail without having any accidents.I have had multiple friends tell me that they wish they had bought the diaper champ after seeing how it worked.,[]
They purchased the more complicated brands.The other great thing about not having to use the specialized bags is that you can use it for cloth diapers as well.,[]
It is spill proof and you can use the basin bag free!,[]
This was a gift to me son and daughter-in-law.,[]
"My son was the one who actually asked for this and he loves, loves, LOVES it!",[]
"After returning to Diaper geinie's, I heard about this.",[]
I am so glad I found it.,[]
It just dosen't get any easier than this and such a wonderful concept!,[]
"I love the diaper champ for how many diapers it holds and the fact you don't have to buy special bags for it, but it doesn not keep in the odors.",[]
I feel like I have to change the bag more often so I don't know how much I'm really saving by not buying the special bags that a diaper genie requires.,[]
I spray the pail after every use and have cleaned it out with bleach and it still smells.,[]
Great idea but it just doesn't work.,[]
I haven't gone back to the diaper genie yet...is there anything else out there that works?,[]
I was definately excited to have a diaper pail capable of keeping smells down and holding more diapers.,[]
I have two little ones under the age of two.,[]
"I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up.",[]
I guess mine could be broken but I think its just poor design.,[]
It also seems to be no better than the competitors at keeping diaper smells in the pail.,[]
The plus is that it uses regular trash bags.,[]
I hated this diaper pail.,[]
"I returned it, then bought the Diaper Dekor its the best one by far.",[]
There is no smell at all and its nice looking.,[]
Works wonders.,[]
The only foul aroma you will smell is when you change the trash bag.,[]
"Otherwise, you tape your diaper up (with the velcro tabs) put it in the hole, turn the handle, and viola...your done.",[]
I own both the Diaper Champ and the &quot;other one&quot;.,[]
I have had the &quot;other one&quot; for two years now and cannot wait to get my toddler out of diapers so I can get rid if it.,[]
I bought the Diaper Champ for my newborn and have had for 2 months and LOVE IT!,[]
"Easy to use, easy to clean, and I use tall kitchen garbage bags so emptying it is a breeze!",[]
I wipe it out with Lysol Wipes everytime I change the bag and spray the openings with Lysol once a day and have zero odor problems.,[]
Hint: I also put a dryer sheet at the bottom of the pail in the bag so it gets tossed every time I change the bag and a fresh one gets put in!,[]
Enjoy this product - Wish I had known about it with my first child!,[]
"I've had other pails and this one is the best in my opinion!No special bags to buy, standard trash bags work and I have even used a grocery store bag in a pinch....",[]
SAVES MONEY!!,[]
"!No smell or odor released in the room, as there is NO lid to open.",[]
"Drop the diaper in the hole, swivel the lid and the diaper is in the bag and the room still smells good!With a newborn, I was able to get a week worth of diapers in one bag before having to empty - so it is a good size, but not too big where it takes up space in the room.I also spray it down with disinfectant between each bag change and after four weeks, the pail is not holding any odor in it!","[('diaper', 0.09992126552161569)]"
This was a product that the new mother had chosen as one of her preferred gifts.,[]
I was pleased with the quality & I know that the new mother found this to be invaluable in the nursery,[]
This product is great!,[]
No odor whatsoever & so easy to use.We use a well-known name brand scented trash bag with drawstrings that is meant for kitchen use.,[]
It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.,[]
"Yes--it may feel like it is resisting slightly when the unit becomes full, so change at least once a week.",[]
(How much longer than that do you really want a bag full of you-know-what sitting in your child's room anyway?),[]
"Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.",[]
Highly recommended.,[]
We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags.,[]
I love that you can use trash bags.,[]
I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough.,[]
"For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway.",[]
The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit.,[]
Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though.,[]
So overall I love the Diaper Champ!,[]
"This product was recommended to us by a friend, and when I realized it was the only one out there that could use ANY plastic bags (not forcing you to buy theirs), I was sold.",[]
"I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!",[]
"I have never caught one single whiff from the Diaper Champ, except just slightly when I open it to remove a full bag (and even then it's not bad -- I mean, you would logically tie off the top of the bag as soon as you get in there, right?",[]
I don't linger over it and breathe deep!),[]
"The two complaints I'd read in reviews were that it smells, and that it's too small and has to be emptied too often.",[]
"As for the smell, I am really particular about smells in my house, and I never smell a thing.",[]
"Someone mentioned something about a ""seal"" breaking, which then caused it to leak odor -- the construction is so simple, I can't even find a seal that might break!?",[]
"I've compared it with friends who have babies around the same age as mine, and use the Diaper Genie and Diaper Dekor, and neither of them keep the odor locked away nearly as well as mine -- in fact, my friends with the other models have said, when they realize how well ours works, that they wish they had bought the Diaper Champ instead.","[('friends', 0.14012842010844978)]"
"And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??",[]
"The best part of all for me, though (besides the smell factor, or lack thereof) is that you can use ANY plastic bags with it.",[]
"I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!",[]
"You can't beat that, plus you aren't tied in to buying overpriced Diaper Genie type refill packs for the duration your child is in diapers.",[]
I agree with previous reviewers about how well this diaper champ works.,[]
"Once our daughter's diapers became ""stinkier"", we used a ""stick up"" air freshener along with more frequent emptying of the bag.",[]
"The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.",[]
"As long as there are no diaper leaks, you can do that, thus saving on more plastic in the landfills!",[]
This diaper pail is definitely the best!,[]
When I was home for the first 8 weeks it seem'd ok.,[]
It was when I went back to work that it didn't work.,[]
It's ok when you change the bag alot.,[]
It fills up pretty quickly so it's not too bad.,[]
"Now that she's in day care full time, I don't fill it up fast enough and the room would smell like diapers.",[]
so I used it for the first 8 weeks and now not at all.,[]
"If I were to do it again, I would just buy the disposable garbage bags they sell for the diaper bags and just put them in my regular trash.",[]
That is what I do now and have no problems with smells.,[]
"Munchkin sells awesome bags for dirty diapers, they come in a little duck for your diaper bag.",[]
Those are awesome!!,[]
!,[]
This has been a great product for diaper disposal for me.,[]
My son is 15 mo.,[]
now and I've used it since he was born.,[]
I've never had a problem with odors and I need to change bags about twice a week.,[]
It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.,[]
I would recommend this over the Diaper Genie.,[]
I received my first diaper champ as a hand-me-down and I absolutely love it!,[]
There's no odor from the pail and it is far easier to use than the genie.,[]
"I don't know if there's very little odor because my son is breastfed, but even with the addition of solids, there's no stinky smell in the house.",[]
We only have to change the pail when it's full.,[]
I've placed an AirWick stick-up in the pail for good measure.,[]
"Also, there are no special refills to buy, you can use regular trash bags.",[]
You can spend as much on 2 months (or less!),[]
of genie refills as you would to purchase the Champ.,[]
"All in all, an excellent buy!",[]
"This is absolutely, by far, the best diaper pail money can buy.",[]
Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).,[]
For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.,[]
"We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.",[]
We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.,[]
We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it's getting stuck...then we change the bag.,[]
For us this means about once a week.,[]
"Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it's kind of fun.",[]
Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.,[]
But she's two months old now and we still just can't say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.,[]
"She's eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it's job.",[]
We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.,[]
"Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.",[]
Everything is just fine after that.,[]
We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough.,[]
I was unsure (after reading others reviews)if this would be worth the money.,[]
It is a wonderful product.,[]
We have one upstairs and downstairs.,[]
You never smell anything from these!,[]
And you can use any trashbags you want.,[]
We love it.,[]
"I've never tried the Diaper Genie, but from what I understand, it's a two handed operation.",[]
"Most mom's know - that second hand became attached to that baby as soon as it was born, and you aren't getting it back any time soon!",[]
"I can drop a diaper into the ""chute"", then flip it in  with the same hand.",[]
No twisting little sausage link things together.,[]
"And for Pete's sake, I do NOT have time to go running around after Diaper Genie refills.",[]
I like that I can use the same bags I use for the kitchen trash that I buy at the grocery store and don't have to make 20 extra trips a year for refills.,[]
My time is precious!,[]
"And unless you're buying a year's supply of refills at once, it's time wasted that could be better spent.",[]
Not to mention the $$$.,[]
"I haven't experienced any smell from this thing yet, and it's been very easy to keep clean.",[]
A great product!,[]
I received the Diaper Genie for my baby shower and used it with my first son for about two weeks.,[]
What a mess and hassle!,[]
I finally bought the Diaper Champ for him at 17 months after friends raved about it and what a fabulous difference!,[]
"No special bags, easy to use, easy to empty, no hassle.",[]
I am expecting my second very soon and contemplated just sharing the Champ between two kids.,[]
"Well, it is so efficient that I bought another one for the other nursery.",[]
Did I mention there were no smells???,[]
?Can not tell you the world of difference between the diaper champ and diaper genie.,[]
FABULOUS!,[]
I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).,[]
But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.,[]
The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).,[]
The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.,[]
It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.,[]
This is not one handed operation as the box states.,[]
After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.,[]
And you do not even need to ask.,[]
"Yes, it was made in China.",[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
Those of you complaining about the smell must not know what it was like 12 or 9 years ago when I had my other kids.,[]
There was nothing this good then.,[]
I have been using this pail since day 1 and my son is now 4 months old.,[]
"The changing area is right next to my bed and I have never had any odor, that I noticed, from the pail.",[]
I asked a few friends if they could smell anything (I thought maybe I was just used to it) and they have said no.,[]
"Sometimes I do have to press down the plunger, but since I roll up the diapers it is no big deal.",[]
"I have also taken to shaking the pail to fit more, so we don't have to empty it as often, again no big deal.",[]
"Every once in a while I use a baby wipe to wipe down both sides of the plunger section, usually if my other children have recently changed a poopy diaper (they don't roll the diapers up to well).",[]
"I have not cleaned the inside of the pail yet, but expect that I will in the near future.",[]
You can't expect to put all those diapers in there without the smell getting through onto the plastic.,[]
"(I threw away my old pail, not been used in 7 years, because it still smelled.)",[]
"I expect to use this diaper pail for the duration, and if it does break I will get another of the same.",[]
"This is a great diaper container and the fact that it uses normal garbage bags, makes it cost effective.",[]
"If we had to do it again, we would buy this again!",[]
Don't waste your money!,[]
"It sounds good on paper, but I had to go out and buy another system, this one kept getting diapers and wipes stuck in it (not the kind of thing you want to have to rip out with your hands) and I had smelling issues with it (mostly because it kept getting stuck open).",[]
I wouldn't wish this product on my worst enemy!,[]
"We started with a diaper pail, went to the diaper genie (replaced three times as it broke within two months each time), and now to the diaper champ.",[]
This one is the best of the bunch.,[]
Takes your standard kitchen trash bag instead of expensive refills and keeps odor as good or better than the other two I mention above.,[]
"Sturdy construction, easy operation.",[]
I highly recommend this product for several reasons:1) You do not have to buy bag refills.,[]
You can use regular trash bags which cuts down on additional spending.,[]
The trash bag is also very easy to take out and to put in.2) Traps in stinky diaper odor.,[]
We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.,[]
"You just put the diaper into the slot and turn the handle, the plunger pushes the diaper into the bag.",[]
We love this product!,[]
We originally were going to purchase the Diaper Genie until we read the reviews.,[]
We have never been so happy for reading reviews.,[]
This is the best.,[]
It is easy to use and there is no odor.,[]
We only have to change the bags about once every 5 days or so.,[]
The best part is that you can use any garbage bag and you dispose of the diapers one handed.,[]
"My friend who received the Diaper Genie as a gift, wants to get rid of it and get the Diaper Champ.",[]
Get the Champ!,[]
It's the best!,[]
A comparison of the Diaper Champ to the Diaper Genie:  We used the Diaper Genie for our first 3 kids and have now had the Diaper Champ for the last 17 months since my 4th was born.,[]
"So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.",[]
The Diaper Champ is much easier to operate - it's even simple to use one-handed so you can hold the baby on the changing table with one hand and dispose of the diaper quickly with the other.,[]
It's also fantastic that you can use regular garbage bags instead of somewhat expensive refills.,[]
"However, the Diaper Champ is not as good with odors.",[]
This wasn't noticible until the baby got to be a year old as his diet changed.,[]
For those who say the Diaper Champ is as good as the Genie with smells - they either haven't compared them head-to-head or they're baby is not old enough yet.,[]
"But, it's obvious that it won't be as good - with the Genie, each diaper is essentially sealed like a sausage link in a plastic bag while with the Champ, the diapers are sitting in a bag.",[]
"So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.",[]
"That being said, with the money you save on refills, you could buy a champ for the first year and then switch later if you don't like the smells yourself - that's my recommendation.",[]
"We have been using the Diaper Champ for 8 months now, and absolutely LOVE it!",[]
One regular kitchen garbage bag lasts at least one week (and this is w/ a very regular baby pooper factory).,[]
There have been no problems w/ odors arising from it like some others have posted.,[]
"The only thing I can think is that they aren't using a simple, plastic, tall kitchen garbage bag to line it with.",[]
Simply simple and brilliant!,[]
Would HIGHLY recommend this to EVERYONE!,[]
You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.,[]
No buying pricey refils for this.,[]
"Do yourself and your nose a favor, buy the Diaper Champ!",[]
I registered for the Diaper Champ based on a recommendation from a friend.,[]
"It's was great at first... used regular trash bags... very easy to use, but then as time passed it got harder and harder to keep it smelling clean.",[]
I think the plastic really absorbs odors.,[]
I cleaned it out everytime I emptied it.,[]
"I tried sprays, cleaning products, baking soda, even bleach, but nothing could keep it smelling good.",[]
"After a year, it threw it out and bought a Diaper Genie which isn't perfect, but better.",[]
Don't waste your time and money.,[]
"This thing is large, clunky, and worst of all doesn't do anything to contain the smell.",[]
"My daughter is 9 days old, primarily feeding on breast milk, and our entire second floor smells like dirty diapers.",[]
"We're going to try the Diaper Genie next, refill costs notwithstanding.",[]
I bought this pail b/c it doesn't require a certain bag and can use my accumulating plastic bags from the store.,[]
It would be perfect if it was a little bigger since I like to use our kitchen bag but the bag doesn't fill up-I'm cheap.,[]
I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.,[]
Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.,[]
"After using this diaper pail for 6 months, I'm rethinking the need for it.",[]
I hate emptying the stinky thing every 3 days or so.,[]
The kitchen trash gets emptied almost daily.,[]
"It is really no trouble to change baby, then scoop him up and carry him and soiled diaper to the kitchen to dispose of the diaper.",[]
I love the diaper Champ.,[]
"I have a 1, 2, 3yr old and am expecting my 4th baby any day now.",[]
For the past 3 years I have owned 3 Diaper Genies and found that they leak odor something horrible.,[]
Finally I decided that with 3 kids in diapers/pull-ups and another coming soon I needed to try something different.,[]
I bought the Diaper Champ and will never look back.,[]
"I's easy to put together, just screw on the base and use it.",[]
It is defenitely tht most user friendly of all.,[]
"If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.",[]
You just drop the diaper into the hole and pull the lever.,[]
The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!,[]
It's a lot cheaper using your own trash bags than having to buy refills and deciding which stage refills you need.,[]
"And not to mention waiting for the sales of buying 3, get the 4th free!",[]
I found that by using grocery bags keeps the smell virtually non-existent.,[]
"I do empty it more often than if I used full size trash bags, but what do you do with all those grocery bags anyway?",[]
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and only wish that I had found it with my first baby.,[]
I would have saved a lot of money and nausea with later pregnancies!,[]
!,[]
Great product!,[]
No smells.,[]
No expensive bag refills to buy.,[]
Very easy to use!,[]
No complaints.,[]
"For the first few months, especially with breastfeeding, I had no almost no problems with the Diaper Champ, but now that the diapers have gotten stinkier, I am definitely smelling it ouside the container.",[]
"It goes away after a while, but it sticks around longer than I'd like.",[]
And I have ripped off more nails than I care to remember trying to open the top to change the bag.,[]
"Other than that, this is a great product, purchased primarily to avoid buying future diaper refills.",[]
"I really loved my Diaper Champ in the beginning, when my daughter's newborn poop didn't smell horrible because she wasn't yet eating solid foods.",[]
"I just bought standard kitchen sized garbage bags to put in it, which was much cheaper than those sold for the Diaper Genie system.",[]
"The Champ wasn't stinky and worked pretty well for the relatively odor-free, smallish diaper loads my daughter produced.However, by the time she was around 4-6 months and eating solids (when her poop began to stink) we had to change the Champ's bag much more frequently--not too big of a deal.",[]
"My main gripe with this product was that sometimes the larger, fuller diapers would be too big for the Champ's chute and, when we would try to deposit them into the champ, the rotating mechanism would create a really messy problem in the chute area.",[]
Really messy.,[]
"The Champ cleaned up well the first few times this happened but then developed an unpleasant, funky smell that no amount of cleaner could eradicate.",[]
We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.,[]
I definitely wouldn't recommend using it past your kid's first birthday.,[]
"However, it is much less expensive in the long run than a Diaper Genie, and I felt like I got my money's worth out of it.",[]
"I was excited to find this product and touted it to all my pregnant friends....too bad, shortly after my daughter was born I found that this contraption was stinking me out of her nursery.",[]
I am very surprised to see any positive reviews.,[]
I tell everyone I know who is having a new baby to get this instead of the Genie.,[]
The biggest advantage is being able to use regular kitchen size garage bags.,[]
The Genie refills are expensive and do not last very long.,[]
The Champ also holds more diapers and is easy to use with larger sized diapers as baby grows.,[]
You will get a smell when the Champ is full.,[]
I just give mine a spray of Lysol when I change the bags--- something you would do with the Genie too.,[]
I also don't think it's hard to change the bags--- you just have to do it a few times.,[]
I used a Diaper Genie with my first baby and switched to a regular trash can after a few months.,[]
"With my second child I got the Diaper Champ and it is so much easier, economical and more eco-friendly.",[]
I've been using it for 5 years.,[]
Very easy to use and much easier than Diaper Genie.,[]
NO SPECIAL BAGS!,[]
We are in month 5 and virtually no odor.,[]
Wish they made a device like this for cats.,[]
I loved this product while it still worked!,[]
There is a foam pad inside that keeps the smell from escaping.,[]
"Mine kept my son's room odor free until the foam broke down, which took about a year.",[]
"Currently, I am getting ready to use the same one over again for my second child.",[]
"I still highly recomend this product and in fact, I have purchased it again for a friend's baby shower!",[]
I bought this with my son in April 2004 and love this item.,[]
I have found that it is super easy to change out the bags and even easier to use.,[]
It works one handed.,[]
"I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.",[]
"It is so easy to use that he always puts his own diaper in there and can make it go ""bye-bye"" on his own.I am exzpecting another child in August 2005 and will continue to use this diaper champ.I highly recommend this item.",[]
I've been using the Diaper Champ for 6 months now and I LOVE IT!,[]
"At first, when I was breast feeding, I didn't notice any odor.",[]
"But just recently, I started to notice some odor escaping and it was quite bad when I opened it to be emptied.",[]
The solution?,[]
I keep a box a baking soda next to it.,[]
"All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.",[]
"You don't need to sprinkle every diaper (I do every 3 or 4, mainly when I think of it) to get good results.",[]
And baking soda is cheap and safe!,[]
A perfect combination.,[]
We used the Diaper Genie for our 5-year-old... and I had to do a lot to keep my wife from buying a new one before he was out of the diapers because of the awful smell.,[]
"When he was finished with it, I boxed it and put it in the attic to save for the next child.",[]
"When I recently opened the box, I nearly gagged.",[]
Then I went to the local Toys'R'Us and bought the Fisher-Price &quot;Odorless&quot; diaper disposal --- what a mistake!,[]
"The first one was broken, so I drove back to get another.",[]
"It wasn't broken this time, but it allowed the diaper mess smell to permeate the entire 2nd floor of our house.",[]
"The Diaper Champ may cost a few bucks more, but there is no comparison in functionality.",[]
"The &quot;Champ&quot; is super-easy to use, and works great!!!",[]
No one should be without it if there is a baby in the house.,[]
"I haven't used the Diaper Genie, but I know that you have to buy special bags to use in it... the Diaper Champ uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags, and I haven't noticed any odor leaking out of this thing!",[]
"It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.",[]
A must have for new parents!,[]
One star is one too many for this piece of crap.,[]
The Diaper Champ SUCKS!!,[]
I have zero praise to offer.,[]
It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.,[]
SAVE YOUR MONEY!,[]
"You can have mine, it's on the curb waiting for the garbage collectors to come get it.",[]
This is an awesome product.,[]
It is so easy and uses regular 13 gal bags.,[]
"Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.",[]
It is quick and even if you are thowing away a q-tip it is simple to trash it.,[]
My baby is 2 wks old.,[]
"My husband and I decided to get this one over the Diaper Genie because like most people, we didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.",[]
We went to Costco and bought a big thing of garbage bags to use that seems to be lasting us FOREVER.,[]
"Our daugher is now 4 months old, and we never had a problem with this.",[]
No odor or anything.,[]
"Extremely easy to use, no assembly required.",[]
This is the worst diaper pail ever with my daughter we had a genie and I did get annoyed with having to buy refills.,[]
"So when I saw the champ I thought that is great and the reviews I read were great, however this thing doesn't keep any odor in.",[]
"I change the bag every other day and use scented trash bags, yet everytime I enter the room I gag.",[]
"The other day I had company so I change the bag and she said and I quote "" Oh my gosh it stinks in here"", how embarrassing.",[]
I was mortified so back to the genie I go.,[]
How disappointing,[]
My husband and I spent about half of an hour comparing diaper pails.,[]
We decided to register for the Diaper Champ.,[]
It's now in my little boy's room and I must say that I love this diaper pail.,[]
The flip-flop depository keeps the odors locked in where they belong...in the diaper pail.,[]
I think this is the best invention yet.,[]
Its economical and it works great.,[]
"Easy one handed motion, flip, flip.",[]
"I have never had any smells problem, my daughter is formula fed, but in case I put a lil stick um on the (freshener) just incase.",[]
The bags are any old trash bags which is cheaper and easier to have.,[]
You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.,[]
I higly recommend this to any parent.,[]
"I love how easy it is to use this product and it's even better that there are no special bags to buy for it, normal trash bags work great.",[]
There is no smell problem and when it gets full (which it eventually does) it's not hard to change the bag.,[]
"I didn't like the diaper genie, it was too complicated, but this thing is so easy.",[]
My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.,[]
I figured if it worked for the pediatrician's office it certainly would work in our house!,[]
I read reviews on this site before buying this diaper pail.,[]
"I thought it was going to work well, and I had high expectations.",[]
"Unfortunately, it broke after only two weeks of use, and since it was kept in our baby's bedroom, it wasn't even used all the time -- it was only used when we changed a diaper upstairs.I was VERY disappointed that I didn't keep the receipt.",[]
I would have made Babies R Us take it back.I recently had a friend over to see the baby.,[]
She saw the diaper pail (we hadn't pitched it yet) and asked me if I liked it.,[]
I told her that it had broken and was a waste of [$$$].,[]
My friend said that she had the same one and that it had also broken quickly (after approximately 4 weeks of use)!,[]
"Obviously, there's a pattern here.I have a Diaper Genie now, and I'm pleased with it.",[]
"I had to read the instructions on how to use it, but it's been working well (thank goodness).",[]
"First, you can use any bag you want.",[]
This is good - right everybody.,[]
Second it doesn't stink...unless you have 10 pounds of stinky diapers in there.,[]
You need to empty this once a week.,[]
I would even say you have more days I just like to be safe - my baby poops a lot.,[]
I am very satisfied with the diaper champ.,[]
It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.,[]
I took the advise of other reviewers and put a box of baking soda on the bottom.,[]
They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.,[]
I also have  a deodorant stick that I put in just to head off any odor.,[]
I did buy the scented garbage bags and have had no problems so far even when I don't empty it for days.,[]
My daughter is going on 3 months and has had some pretty dirty diapers but so far no odor problems.,[]
My mother and aunt also commented that they liked it better than the Diaper Jeannie that my sister in law has.,[]
"I chose this over the Diaper Genie b/c I don't have to spend anymore money for ""special"" bag refills.",[]
I can easily use all my plastic grocery & shopping bags.,[]
Just empty the DC often & voila!,[]
no stinky diaper pail.,[]
"Also, a little Lysol spray doesn't hurt either.",[]
I do recommend being careful when opening & closing the Diaper Champ to empty it.,[]
I have broken several nails & hurt my fingers when opening it & it has startled me & the baby when it slams shut.,[]
"I was going to buy the Genie but, read all the reviews and decided on the Champ and I am so glad I did!!",[]
It is so easy to use and takes any kind of bag.,[]
So all you pay for is the Champ and not extra money on refills.,[]
I'd rather spend my money on other things not on refills for 2 years.,[]
It also does a great job at keeping the smells locked it.,[]
A great buy for any parent!,[]
"At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.",[]
We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.,[]
(We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!),[]
It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.,[]
We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.,[]
One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.,[]
"Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!",[]
I was going to get the Diaper Genie which I had with my daughter but saw the Diaper Champ and the store.,[]
A lady walking by stopped and recommended it to me.,[]
I put it on my registry and received it.,[]
I love it.,[]
"The chute will get dirty if you have anything dirty going in it but if you can not fold a dirty diaper up, just wrap a baby wipe around it before sending it into the Champ.",[]
I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.,[]
All you need is a Philips screw driver.,[]
I got the handle apart and was able to see what makes this wonderful pail work.,[]
I filled it with Bleach and water and hosed it off in the yard with the water hose.,[]
I then sprayed it down with Lysol and let it dry upside down on a towel.,[]
The only smells I have are the ones in the room from changing the diaper.,[]
"Once I get rid of the diaper in the Champ and a few minutes go by, the room is back to it's regular smell.",[]
To fit as many diapers as possible in it I fold them up real tight before putting them into the Champ and I shake the pail a little so they are spread out in the bag.,[]
I really love this pail!,[]
I think this thing is great.,[]
"Although I just bought mine, I like it much better than my diaper genie.",[]
"THOSE things are confusing, not this thing.",[]
"You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending ""money"" for refills, etc.",[]
"You put in a regular trash bag, close the lid, stick the diaper in the hole, flip the handle, and you're done.",[]
"When it's full, (geez it holds a lot!)",[]
"open the top, grab the bag, and throw it all away.",[]
"Did I mention, a bag?",[]
"A real, inexpensive, run-of-the-mill trash bag!",[]
"Believe it, folks!",[]
"With all the refills you buy for the other diaper disposal, you could buy 20 Diaper Champs.",[]
Clean the thing.,[]
The whole thing.,[]
"Hey, it's worth it!",[]
"Don't be lazy, and your nursery won't stink!",[]
"We expect diaper disposals to be able to feed and raise our kids, plus wipe peanut butter and jelly off the walls.",[]
Nothing is going to be completely odor and work-free.,[]
"Great purchase, definitely reccommend.",[]
Glad Odor Shield trash bags will definitely keep the odor out of the Diaper Champ.,[]
I ran out of the Odor shield trash bags and could definitely tell the difference.,[]
I now keep extra stock.,[]
"We've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!",[]
The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!,[]
"We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.",[]
"I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.","[('champ', 0.12431294196997547)]"
"So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!",[]
"The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.",[]
"Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.",[]
I love my Diaper Champ.,[]
"My son is 9 months old and I have not had any problems with it.Yes, when it gets full it doesn't close so well, CHANGE THE BAG.It can smell a little when it is full or hot,  CHANGE THE BAG.You can fit more diapers if you really wrap the diaper tight with the tape.I use deoderant bags and they are great.I have four other friends that have recently had babies and I have suggested this to all of them.",[]
"We're expecting our first in June, and so while shopping/registring have been relying on recommendations from friends and the product reviews on this site.",[]
"We had been considering the Diaper Champ, and hoped that it would live up to the accolades we'd read.",[]
"We actually got a chance to try it out:My mother recently had a stroke, and as a result, she wound up with some incontinence issues.",[]
"We got her some pads to deal with it, which solved one problem, but then presented another: the smell.",[]
"Since we'd been considering getting a Diaper Champ for the baby, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try out it's ability to keep the nursery from smelling like a dirty diaper.We've been using it for my mom for about a month now and I have to say the smell problem has been solved.",[]
"Sure, it's no fun when you change the bag, but for the few seconds of breath-holding while you whip that sucker out and tie it off...",[]
I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.,[]
"Plus it's super easy to use with the one-hand operation -- just drop it in, flip the handle and you're done.I highly recommend it for anyone who's concerned about containing the smell and avoiding the expense of those refil packs.",[]
My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.,[]
No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise!,[]
I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!,[]
This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.,[]
At first we were pleased with the Diaper Champ because of its easy-to-use function and the fact that we did not have to buy special refills or bags.,[]
"However, we quickly learned that the biggest drawback to the Champ is its inability to seal in odor.",[]
"We frequently empty the bags and clean the pail (including Lysol, chlorine bleach, and anti-bacterial wipes) but have found the odor to be overwhelming and ever present regardless of disinfectant or frequent bag changes.",[]
"Recently in a popular parenting magazine, they reviewed various diaper disposal systems and used Limburger cheese (a very potent and stinky cheese) to measure odor levels among the various systems.",[]
Diaper Champ received the worst rating for odor (4 cheese wedges indicating the worst odor rating possible.),[]
"I would avoid the hassle, spend a few extra bucks and get one of the other, higher-rated and popular systems.",[]
This diaper pail is so easy to use.,[]
It doesn't smell and is easily one of the best baby products that we own.,[]
The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.,[]
I highly recommend this over any other diaper pail in the market.,[]
"Thank goodness we found something better and easier than ""genie""!",[]
"!This one works great, no difficulty loading bags or putting diapers in.Only reason for not 5 stars is a little odor escapes but in my opinion well worth the offsetting ease of use.",[]
"We didn't want to spend a fortune on a diaper pail and refills, so we opted for the Diaper Champ.",[]
We absolutely love it.,[]
We have used it for three months now and have had no problems with smells of any kind.,[]
"Best of all, you can use any kind of bag, including reused plastic grocery bags!",[]
I registered for the diaper champ when I found out I was pregnant.,[]
I knew that I didn't want the genie because I didn't want to invest in those refill bags.,[]
"With the champ, I can just put a regular trash bag in it and save a bundle.",[]
And the one handed handle action is great when you have a wiggling baby in your other arm.,[]
I would suggest the diaper champ over the diaper genie to any expecting mother.,[]
You'll be glad you bought it.,[]
"I'm a first time mom, so of course I knew nothing about diapers and diaper pails.",[]
Several friends recommended the Diaper Genie but I took a shot in the dark and registered for the Diaper Champ - boy am I glad I did!,[]
I like the fact that you can use any kind of bags and the diaper disposal is so easy.,[]
I knew it was a winner when my husband was impressed.,[]
"So impressed, he even changes the bags (which we do every 2 days or so).",[]
"I'm starting to notice a slight odor, but that's only when the bag gets full.",[]
"My daughter's diet is changing, so I'm sure the ""odor"" will only increase, but it's definitely better than throwing the messy diapers in the trash.",[]
"To those who are unsure about which diaper pail is best, try this one - you won't be sorry!",[]
I had checked into all of the pails before I had my little girl.,[]
"I heard great things about all of them, but wanted what would be most cost effective for us.",[]
"When we decided on the diaper champ, we won!1.",[]
No refills to every buy.,[]
you can use a standard trash bag and you don't have to spend the extra money for those refills.2.,[]
I empty mine once a week on trash day and it is full.,[]
"However, there is never a smell eminating from my champ.3.",[]
No stinky smells in my home.,[]
"Even though my daughter is only 2 months old, she has some of THE stinkiest diapers I have ever smelt!",[]
"But, there has never been any leakage of smell and it does not stink when I open it to change it.4.",[]
I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.,[]
"Since those stinky diapers camp out in there for a week, it needs to be freshened up every now and then.Verdict:Get the champ....it will save you tons in the long run!!",[]
!,[]
This is a waste of money.,[]
No matter what you do it still smells!,[]
Also very hard to clean!,[]
"It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.",[]
My suggestion would be not to throw diapers in the trash cans inside the house just tie them up in a plastic sack maybe even a sented one and throw it away in your trash can outside to emliminate smell!!,[]
"b/c not matter what you do if you put dirty diapers inside ANYWHERE they will smell, even when using this!",[]
!,[]
This diaper pail is so much better than the diaper genie!,[]
You just drop the diaper in the chute!,[]
I have had it for 5 months and there is no odor (I keep it in the bathroom).,[]
The d.g.,[]
I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.,[]
"Other than that, it's great - no special bags to buy; no cutting when you need to change the bag,  - do yourself a favor and get this over the d.g.",[]
I am giving this Diaper Champ 4 stars instead of 5 only because I have trouble opening it to change it.,[]
"Now before that discourages you, it is only fair to say I also have trouble openning our child safty gates too, and you don't want your toddler playing in here once they are mobile!I have read other reviews where customers have been disapointed that there is still a dirty diaper smell with this product.",[]
"I will say that as long as you are changing the pail before it is overflowing this is usually not the case for me and often when the pail is crammed full the smell is from an ""over achieving diaper"" that has come open and messed the openning a bit.I have been pleased with this product and would definatly purchace again.",[]
"The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.",[]
"Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish ""Pink Bunny"" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.","[('openning', 0.096633526209691)]"
"If it is easy to use, your toddler may toss their toys in there for entertainment and howl for you to get them out.",[]
)All and all I think this is the best diaper pail on the market.,[]
Pink Bunny adventures and all;),[]
My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.,[]
"It is ultra convient when you have your hands full with a dirty diaper and a kicking, squirming wiggle worm.",[]
"There has been no smell at all, and the champ's generous size allows plenty of diapers, which is important because it seems as though there is no time to do ANYTHING!!!",[]
I would recomend this product to any and all people with babies.,[]
We have been using this for about 6 months now for our baby girl.,[]
This is better than some of the other ones we have tried since some use too much bags and others are too complicated one handed.,[]
"You also use your own garbage bags, not some over priced special ones.This one is great!!",[]
One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle.,[]
"If you think it has a smell, drop in one dryer sheet and you won't notice anything!We really recommend it!",[]
!,[]
I chose the Diaper Champ over the DIFFICULT to use Diper Genie!Diaper Champ is easy to use.,[]
"One handed disposal, no need to purchase ""special"" bags or deordorants.",[]
The smell refered to by others is really no worse than when you change a full diaper.,[]
It is the safest pail I've seen.,[]
NO RISK OF DROWNING HERE!,[]
"The latch is ""childproof"" so it takes a little practice but its well worth it",[]
I previously owned a Diaper Genie and also didn't like the idea of buying liners and how few diapers it held.,[]
When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.,[]
"Don't let the base fool you, it is much smaller on the inside for holding disposed diapers.",[]
"Also, I kept thinking my son had a dirty diaper, when in fact it was the Diaper Champ I was smelling.",[]
"The Diaper Champ is residing in the garage after only 3 weeks of use, and I purchased another Diaper Genie, which I think ended up holding just as many diapers as the Diaper Champ.",[]
I love this product - it is very easy to use and there is no odor at all.,[]
I am still breastfeeding my son so I don't know whether the odor is going to kick in when he starts solids.,[]
"At this time, I am very satisfied with the Diaper Champ.",[]
I highly recommend this product - you can practically use any plastic bags - we just use the shopping bags we get from stores.,[]
I changed my registry from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews for the Diaper Champ online.,[]
I'm very happy with it.,[]
Our baby's cradle is in our room so we keep the Champ in there with us.,[]
There are no odor problems whatsoever.,[]
I also love that you don't have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn't release very smoothly.,[]
"When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.",[]
"I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn't taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!)",[]
"since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.",[]
"Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues.",[]
"When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.",[]
"We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.",[]
"We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.",[]
We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.,[]
We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.,[]
This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.,[]
I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.,[]
"But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.",[]
"We decided on the Diaper Champ, partially by recommendation from a friend, but also because of the convenience of not having to buy refill bags.",[]
"We just use grocery bags or...bags, and have been pleased with how well it works.",[]
"Once your baby starts having really stinky diapers, it's a good idea to try to empty it every day or every other day ... or else the odor can start to fill the room, but even then it's not a terrible odor.",[]
"It's so easy to use, and well as easy to change the bag.",[]
"I just keep a can of Lysol nearby ... when I change the bag, I just spray the Champ with Lysol, and let it air out to help with the smell inside the can.",[]
I have been using the Diaper Champ for now 8 months.,[]
"At first, I was like everybody else, I loved it and thought it was the greatest pail out there.",[]
I made my sister switch from the [other pail] to the Diaper champ and recommended it to all my friends who had babies.,[]
Then a few weeks ago it started to smell.,[]
It seemed like every time the Diaper Champ got at least half full it could not contain the odors anymore.,[]
So I contacted the Customer Service at Baby Trend and explained to them what was going on.,[]
Within one day they replied to my e-mail.,[]
It seems all I need is a new gasket!!,[]
(which they are sending me).,[]
Not only was Customer Service really prompt and efficient but the problem also seems really easy to fix.,[]
Easier than running out to get a Diaper [pail].,[]
"I still say the Diaper Champ is the best out there and I have enjoyed 8 month of nice, clean  smelling baby nursery!!!",[]
Even if the gasket does not fix the problem I will still go and get another Diaper Champ.,[]
At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...,[]
We registered for the Diaper Champ bc it is large enough to accomodate a large number of diapers and you can use your own kitchen bags rather than buying expensive refills.,[]
Our only concern was whether it would really hold in the smell.,[]
We have not been disappointed!,[]
You can't smell the diapers AT ALL!,[]
We do use odorshield kitchen bags just to make sure bc we have it in a main room in our home.,[]
"It holds a lot of diapers, so you're not constantly changing the bag.",[]
"It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!",[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
"Simple design, easy to use, keeps odor contianed very well.",[]
Much better choice than others out there.,[]
I LOVE this diaper pail!,[]
It's easy to change out and doesn't emit any odor!,[]
It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!,[]
I recommend this over ANY pail to anyone.,[]
This is the BEST diaper pail I have ever heard or seen.,[]
It hold a lot of diaper's without a smell of any kind.,[]
I keep an extra bag in the bottom and Lysol next to it.,[]
The only smell it when you change it but it goes away the instant the top is closed.,[]
I heard only bad things about the Diaper Genie and decided that I didn't wanna even mess with it so I registered for this.,[]
Before the baby was born my husband used it to put the dirty cat litter bags in it to test it and after 1-week there wasn't even a smell from that.,[]
It's very easy to use.,[]
I couldn't ask for better.,[]
I researched which diaper pail was better when i was pregnant with my first.,[]
This one seemed to have the most positive reviews so i added it to my registry.,[]
"I got mine 3 1/3 years ago and i'm still using it (going on baby #3).I like the fact that you can use regular trash bags, even the cheap ones!",[]
It's very convenient to use as well.,[]
Lifting the lid can be a little tricky if you have long nails but it's not a big deal once you get used to how it works.The only thing i recommend is to make sure you wash it out and sanitize it at least twice a month because it will eventually starts to smell if not.,[]
"And if you have two kids in diapers like i do, it fills up fast and I have to change the bag twice a week.",[]
With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.,[]
I am still using the same Diaper Champ and I still highly recommend it!,[]
"I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags.",[]
"The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well.",[]
A MUST have!,[]
This is one of the things I can't live without.,[]
There are no bad smells until you open it.,[]
Using regular garbage bags is a huge money saver and there is plenty of room for tons of diapers!,[]
Plus it can also be used as a trash can!,[]
The diaper champ is the best!!!,[]
Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart...I can honestly speak to its worth!,[]
"I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.1) The champ is easy to use.One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.",[]
You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.,[]
"For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.",[]
With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.,[]
It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.,[]
The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.2) The Champ uses regular store bags.You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.,[]
You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.,[]
"Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.",[]
This will never be a problem with the Champ.,[]
Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?,[]
The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.,[]
I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.,[]
If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.,[]
The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks  of use.,[]
"Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.",[]
The positives outway the negatives.,[]
There probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while.,[]
Let the Champ win you over!!,[]
!,[]
"I originally loved this product when I brought it home from the store, so much so that I gave it 5 stars after using it for 3 months.",[]
I even bought one for my brother after the birth of his son.,[]
Well here's the REAL DEAL...,[]
It worked quite well for about 4 to 6 months.,[]
"However, now that I've had it for about 3.5 years, it's ""smellfully"" obvious it doesn't work as designed.I've removed it from the nursery and redeployed it to the guest bathroom.",[]
"To handle the odor that leaks from the champ, I have use the following workaround.",[]
I've purchased Diaper Bags (Sassy Bags) from Wal-Mart/K-Mart and place every soiled diaper in the bag before depositing it into the Diaper Champ.,[]
Wet Diapers are placed in the Champ without having to be placed into a bag.,[]
Why does it leak odor?,[]
"I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.","[('seal', 0.0827748537602753)]"
"However, if you use the soiled diaper workaround I have suggested, it's a 4 or 5 star item because the diaper sac neutralizes the odor and the Champ keeps little hands from playing with the soiled diapers.",[]
We bought this 2 1/2 years ago when my son was born.,[]
It was great and odorless until my son was almost 2 and he wasn't odorless anymore.,[]
It holds alot of Diapers and if one gets stuck it is easy to fix the problem.,[]
I love the fact that I can use my kitchen bags!!,[]
I think the ease of this and the amount of diapers it holds is unbeatable.,[]
My second baby is due in 3 months and I will be pulling this out again.,[]
!,[]
"When it came time to replace our diaper genie, I had a tough time locating a wide-mouth one like we already had so I went online to see what alternatives there were.",[]
I was impressed with the reviews of the diaper champ and got one.,[]
It works wonderfully!,[]
Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!,[]
And you cannot beat the easy changing of the bag inside -- sure do wish I had found this product sooner!,[]
Far superior than the diaper genie.,[]
Easy to use with glad odor bags no smell.,[]
GREAT PRODUCT!,[]
"It is definatley the best diaper pail, especially since you can use regular trash bags.",[]
I didn't smell a thing untill the seal came off in the interior.,[]
Now it stinks to high haties.,[]
"I am trying to see what the warranty is on it, I would buy it again since it saves money on refills but buy it at the store  and save the box you can exchange it should you have the same problem.",[]
I researched ths diaper pails and actually returned the one I already received due to the ratings of the Diaper Champ.,[]
"Though it does use regular trash bags, I use scented bags as it does not ""twist"" the diapers and I am trying to reduce any odor when I open the pail.",[]
"The ""easy to open"" feature is diffucult to open and usually snaps so hard I hurt my fingers .",[]
"The smell is minimal as my child is still a newborn and I do use scented garbage bags, I can only guess that as my child gets older and the diapers get more ""smelly"" I may be in trouble with odor control!",[]
The garbage bag does insert easily but doesn't lock in the system anyway to seem secure.,[]
I think if I had a chance to change diaper pails I would have gone with another Diaper pail.,[]
"We love our babies, and when you need a place to put diapers this is the place.",[]
It uses normal bags and it's designed to hold them in place.,[]
"I have used plastic grocery bags with the handles, as well as tall kitchen bags.",[]
It's nice to just drop in the diaper flip the handle and the diaper is placed in the bag below.,[]
"We have no smells from the Diaper Champ either, it seals well to keep the smell inside.",[]
The changing of the bag will smell so watch for this.,[]
Very good product a must have.,[]
"I love this!Originally, we were using cloth diapers but our baby kept geting rashes so we switched to the disposable.",[]
"With cloth diapers, it couldn't hold more than 1/2 a week of the newborn diapers!",[]
"Since the diaper service came only once a week, this was a bit of a hassle.The disposable are not a problem because they are smaller and we just throw them out, anyway.Very easy to use.",[]
No smell yet.,[]
Very nice.,[]
We received the Diaper Champ at our son's baby shower shortly after he was born.,[]
This is absolutely the best way I have seen to dispose of used diapers on the market today.,[]
All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.,[]
Then you just drop the used diaper in the hole and flip the handle.,[]
That's it.,[]
So simple that it can be done with one hand at 1AM in the morning when even you aren't fully awake!,[]
We have been using it for about 3 1/2 months now and I wouldn't trade it for anything.It's very economical since you can use any available plastic bag plus there is no odor associated with it.,[]
"We normally have to change it about every 3 or 4 days and for our newborn son, that could mean anywhere from 30 to 40 diapers!",[]
This product is well worth the money!,[]
I'm not sure why this thing would get bad reviews.,[]
We love it.,[]
It works incredibly well.,[]
"It's so easy to use, and how cool that you can use any old garbage bag instead of having to buy special ones.",[]
"I was worried that this horrific smell would escape every time I changed the bag, but that hasn't happened and we've had it two months now.",[]
In my opinion this is the best diaper pail out there.,[]
I have twin girls and I think I would go nuts without this pail.,[]
I have many friends with kids ages 6 months to 6 years and all of them recomended this product.,[]
"Once I recieved and started using it, i knew why.",[]
Best things about it 1.,[]
"No smell when closed, yeah you can smell dirty diapers when you open to change the bag, but thats because there are dirty diapers in there.",[]
2,[]
Use your own bags.,[]
I have to change my bag every 3 days or so having twins.,[]
I would be broke if I had to buy special bags just for the pail.,[]
"We bought the Diaper Champ to start with because of the every day trash bags you can use, the holding capicity, ease of use, etc, etc.",[]
Boy were we suckered.,[]
"We have been using this product for 7 and a half months, and that has been about 3 to 4 months to LONG!!!",[]
"As soon as my daughter started solids, the smell has been slowly creeping up a little bit more every day.",[]
Now that thing is stinking the whole house up.,[]
It has no odor control at all.,[]
I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.,[]
Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you.,[]
Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.,[]
I'd say look for something else!,[]
if you want a one and only investment!,[]
I love this diaper champ.,[]
My son is now 2 and I put it on my wish list for his baby shower.,[]
I had received the diaper genie instead because my sister inlaw said it was better and would hold the smell in better.,[]
I quickly returned it because the cost of the refills and the frequent diaper changes would cost me a fortune.,[]
My husband says this is the easiest product to use - he even empties it!!!,[]
Well worth the money - it saved me money in the long run.,[]
I used a Diaper Genie for 2 years and thought it was great - then I had a second baby and realized I was going through the refills pretty fast with two in diapers.,[]
I got a Diaper Champ recently and I love it!,[]
"It's easier to use (not that the Genie was complicated, but it did take more steps to dispose of a diaper and to empty it), but best of all I have figured out I am going to be saving over [$$] a year compared to what I would spend if I continued to use the Genie (that pays for the Champ TWICE!).",[]
"I bought a package of 65 Ruffies scented trash bags for less than [$] - each bag is lasting about 3 days, so this package is going to last 6 1/2 months.",[]
"In that amount of time I would use about 7 Genie refills, which would cost more than 10 times what I spent on the trash bags!",[]
"I was having to empty the Genie about every 3 days as well, so it's no more work for me.",[]
The Diaper Champ has been keeping odors in very well so far.,[]
Overall I am very pleased with the Champ and happy that I made the switch!,[]
you can use any ol' bag with this.,[]
go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags.,[]
they fit it perfectly.,[]
"you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop.",[]
byebye poopy diaper!,[]
it can hold quite a few.,[]
we only need to change the bag once a week.,[]
it really does hide the smell.,[]
the diaper champ is the best!,[]
This product is great all around.,[]
"When selecting this product, it was very important to us not to have an odor problem because my husband has a very sensitve nose AND we live in a one bedroom apartment (which means the diaper champ  was going to be in our bedroom).",[]
We chose the Diaper Champ over the other brands because it did not require expensive refills.,[]
We have been pleased with our purchase--no odor problems even in close proximity and no expensive refills.,[]
We just use regular garbage bags.,[]
Terrific!,[]
I absolutely love this diaper champ.,[]
I was first drawn to it because no special bags were needed.,[]
It is so easy to use - one handed diaper disposable with the quick flip handle and so easy to empty.,[]
This item is a MUST HAVE!!,[]
!,[]
It works ok.,[]
"I've had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I'm going to find something else.",[]
"The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven't compared it with other bins, so I couldn't say whether it's the lesser of evils, but hopefully there's something better out there for the job.","[('something', 0.08916266806165123)]"
I love this because it locks in the odor and it uses regular trash bags.,[]
You don't spend alot of money on the inserts you just use regular trash bags.,[]
It does stink when you open it but I just buy some disinfectant spray and spray it at the bottom of it.,[]
I would recommed it for anyone.,[]
"I REALLY, REALLY wanted this thing to work.",[]
I refused to buy the Diaper Genie because of the special refills.,[]
I saw the Diaper Champ at a local Babies R Us.,[]
"I brought it home, used it and less than 48 hours later, I could smell my 1-year old daughter's stinky diaper.",[]
"My husband thought the engineering of the product was excellent and to this day does not understand why it does not keep the ""stink"" contained.",[]
We finally broke down and bought a Diaper Genie only because I had exhausted all other alternatives and I was tired of Corrin's room smelling like a diaper pail.,[]
"The Diaper Genie prevailed, 7 days later, full of poopy diapers, I still couldn't smell a thing upon entering her room and that is all the proof I need.",[]
We received this last year as a baby shower gift for out twin boys.,[]
It worked for about 4 or 5 months.,[]
When it got close to being full you could smell it.,[]
Now it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 20 diapers in it!,[]
It stinks to high heaven!!!,[]
Now I am looking for a better one than this one.,[]
Tried the diaper genie...hated it...got any suggestions??,[]
?,[]
"We have been using our Diaper Champ for 4 weeks now (trust me, newborns poopy diapers DO smell) and it has met all our expectations.",[]
No odor and easy to use!,[]
"While I personally don't own one, my cousin and his wife got one for their triplets.",[]
"I noticed it when I changed my youngest son's diaper, and I asked them where they got it.",[]
I still want one!,[]
So far so good.,[]
I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.,[]
I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?,[]
"Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.",[]
"I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.",[]
I can see why this product gets great reviews.,[]
Everybody writes their review before they have had to clean it.,[]
My evaluation of the product changed 180 degrees after trying to clean this thing.,[]
When some poop inevitably squeezes out of a diaper that you are trying to dispose of you have a mess to clean up.,[]
I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.,[]
It is difficult to disassemble -- you need a screwdriver!,[]
#NAME?,[]
There is a foam cushion glued to the plastic under the flip assembly and if that gets poopy it smears the poop all over the lid every time you flip it!,[]
How are you supposed to clean the poop out of the foam?,[]
The screws go directly into soft plastic so after a few disassemblies they aren't going to hold anymore.,[]
Next time I'd look into something else.,[]
"While both the Safety First ""Neat Diaper"" and the Baby Trend ""Diaper CHamp"" got good overall reviews, the difference between the ""Neat Diaper"" and the ""Diaper Champ"" is incomparable!",[]
"The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.",[]
"The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.",[]
"ALso, the Neat Diaper requires that you use their brand of plastic bags, which didn't last very long, while the Champ let's you use any common medium trash baggie (though a bit awkward to install) Wasted my money on the Neat Diaper.",[]
Don't know why this problem was not noted by other reviewers.,[]
The Diaper CHamp is our new champion.,[]
I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags.,[]
I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget).,[]
I works great.,[]
The only thing is when it is full it is full.,[]
It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.,[]
I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby's room and would recommend this item.,[]
"After reading the reviews here, we registered for and got the Diaper Champ.",[]
It has been really great!,[]
I love the fact that you can use regular kitchen bags for it - no pricey or special bags needed.,[]
"My son is 3 months old, and I have not ever noticed any bad smells coming from the Diaper Champ.",[]
"We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).",[]
It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.,[]
"One suggestion, though, make sure you have stuck the side fasteners back to the diaper, because if they are flapping loose, they will occasionally get stuck inside the champ.",[]
"Overrated, odor is bad.",[]
"I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.",[]
If you don't want the diaper smell don't get this.,[]
Since I had to do my baby registry by reading books etc.,[]
"as I was stuck in bed, I had time to read review on every item and we decided on the diaper champ.",[]
We absolutely love it.,[]
You do not get any odor.,[]
We change the bag twice a week on garbage days.,[]
A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.,[]
"The only down side is if you have a very dirty diaper the tube where the diaper goes gets dirty and is a bit of a pain to clean, but that only happens on extremely dirty diapers which we only get once in a while.This is a great purchase.",[]
Don't waste money on those pails that require refills or the refills.,[]
This diaper pail is great!,[]
It does not require special bags.,[]
It uses normal tall kitchen garbage bags.,[]
And it does the job - no smell.,[]
My son was born via c-section and I could not climb the stairs for the first week at home so we set everything up in the living room.,[]
The diaper pail was right next to the couch and you could not smell a thing!,[]
This product works wonders in our daughter's room.,[]
"I buy a roll of 13 gallon trash bags, and never have to use the inconvenient refills other diaper pails require.",[]
"Though I must admit, it's slightly annoying to open up, it holds the smell inside and you'd never know what was inside.",[]
I deffinately reccoment this product to anyone who plans on using disposable diapers!,[]
One of the better items we received as a registry gift!,[]
One-handed operation and we can use the same garbage bags we use for the kitchen.,[]
Appreciated as there is no place in our town that sells the competition's refills.,[]
The diaper champ is such a great product.,[]
I keep it in my baby's bedroom in a corner and it has never produced any foul odors.,[]
I love that I can use regular trash bags with it.,[]
I only have to empty the bag once every 2 weeks (since most of the diaper changes happen downstairs).,[]
"But, even going that long, it does not smell.",[]
"I would never use one that required refills, what is the sense in that when this one works perfectly?",[]
!,[]
Our first was born in 2005 and we bought the original version of this diaper pail.,[]
It seemed so sensible.,[]
"We liked it at first, but the smell just kept building...no matter how much I washed it and sprayed it with disinfectant.",[]
Then I realized the rounded part of the lid was lined with foam.,[]
"Of course, once an odor gets into the foam you are doomed.",[]
"So, I removed the foam, but we still had issues with odor.",[]
By now we had our 2nd baby and the pail seemed a little small for 2 in diapers (we emptied it more than twice a week).,[]
"We bought the ""new improved"" version, since we still liked the concept of the pail.",[]
The smell issue is still attrocious and if a bag is really full it rips when you take it out.,[]
I had issues with the old version and I hate the newer version.,[]
I'm buying a really good trash can with a lid that seals out odors.,[]
We use one for cat litter and the smell NEVER escapes from that!,[]
I used both the Champ and the Diaper Genie.,[]
The Champ is wonderful and There are no odor problems.,[]
It has been in daily use for over two years.,[]
You use your own bags and it is simple to operate.,[]
"With the Genie, I threw it out after 2 months.",[]
"The cutter stopped working properly, the twist mechanism also was unreliable, and you have to buy their bags.",[]
Hope this helps anyone researching diaper hampers.,[]
"When my diaper genie broke (cutter piece got rusty or something and wouldnt cut the plastic anymore, and found cutting it with scissors even more of a hassle).",[]
I got online and researched all the diaper pails.,[]
"I had this one in mind ahead of time because I had used it at a friends house and thought it was very easy to use, and hadnt noticed a smell (and she had 2 kids in diapers.)",[]
But I wanted to find out what all was out there.,[]
I definatly did not want to get another pail you had to buy refills for.,[]
I hated this feature about the diaper genie.,[]
"The refills were so expensive and if they didnt have them at the store I was at, I had to run around town looking for them.",[]
"When I was reading the reviews for the champ, I noticed so many conflicting reviews that I really felt like I was taking a big chance by ordering it, but it seemed like the best one, so I was willing to take the chance.",[]
I AM SO GLAD I DID!,[]
This is a great diaper pail.,[]
"Alot of reviews said that it worked great for newborns, but was horrible once the baby started eating solids.",[]
My son is 15 months old and I dont notice a smell at all!,[]
With the genie I had odor problems.,[]
"With this one, I dont even notice it is there.",[]
"The only thing that I do, is (since I dont put the poopies in a seperate plastic bag like some people) if there is still poop showing after wrapping the diaper, I wrap a wipe around it before putting it in the shoot so it doesnt get all over.",[]
"But that is just me, everyone has there own way/ideas.",[]
"Another thing I like about this vs. the genie, is that it holds more diapers.",[]
"When I notice it is starting to get full, I just give it a shake to move the diapers around, and make a mental note to change it when I get a chance, and even if I dont get to it that day, it will still hold diapers tomorrow.",[]
"Wow, I feel like I'm rambling on and on..I just want to let everyone know how much better this pail is than the genie!I will stop now, even though I could go on and on....BUY THIS ONE!",[]
I had my third child almost 3 months ago and decided that I needed a good diaper pail.,[]
"So far, I've been very pleased with this item.",[]
You don't need to buy expensive liners and I haven't had any odor problems at all.,[]
I went through quite a few diapers pails with my first two children and couldn't even keep one in the nursery because they all ended up smelling so badly.,[]
This one is in the nursery!,[]
I bought this product because it was the only one I could find that would work with cloth diapers.,[]
So far it has been perfect.,[]
I have had no problems with odor.,[]
As others have complained.,[]
( My daughter is two months and breast feed.),[]
Also some others complained it didn't work with cloth.,[]
I use double absorbancy cloth diapers this easily holds two days worth 16-18.,[]
I wouldn't suggest anyone leave diapers in any container longer than that.,[]
To keep it clean I wipe down the inside and out with a diaper wipe and spray inside and out with lysol and leave the top open to air dry when I launder the diapers.,[]
Bottom line this is a great product for those using cloth diapers.,[]
I've never even had a problem with it.,[]
There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.,[]
The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.,[]
"Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.",[]
"Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn't have a smell.",[]
We have purchased three diaper pails prior to this one.,[]
This one is a hundred times better.,[]
The other ones always had springs that broke or the lid wouldn't stay shut.,[]
"The Diaper Champ has none of these problems, and it is nice to use regular garbage bags.",[]
"It was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money.",[]
We compared this too the other one and decided we liked the idea of the common garbage bag better.,[]
"I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.",[]
We love this unit and I can't recommend it enough.Buy it and it will serve you well...,[]
With three very large dogs in the house we were very worried about diaper smells when our newborn arrived.,[]
This product is fantastic and incredibly easy to use.,[]
Unlike other brands on the market this one uses regular garbage bags!,[]
I love the diaper champ.It was given to me as a shower gift when my third child was born.,[]
"For my first two kids I used the diaper genie,but I was spending alot of money on the refills.",[]
"The diaper champ is easy to use, and easy to change the plastic bags.I love that almost any bag works, and I don't need to spend $6 a refill.",[]
"Also,with the diaper genie it was always a project for me to get the refills in.",[]
The only benefit the diaper genie has is better odor control.,[]
"The diaper champ gets very stinky, a problem I never had with the diaper genie.",[]
I got the champ before Jack was born and thought I made a wise investment.,[]
"Heard the horror stories and read the reviews on many other diaper pails, so I figured I'd save money on refills and the 'plunger' seemed to be a logical way to prevent the stink.",[]
Worked great in the beginning when Jack was breastfed and even when on formula.,[]
Still okay after introducing cereal and then came the sweet potatoes and squash along with the horrors of stinky diapers.,[]
I emptied the champ more often-like 2-3 times a week even if it was not full.,[]
I still wiped it out with clorox wipes and sprayed lysol every time I changed the bag.,[]
Then I had to start leaving the windows open and the ceiling fan on high-did I mention this was during the summer and we have no a/c??,[]
"?Anyway, Jack will be 2 in May and I am now shopping for a new pail.",[]
I have tried everything including dropping in a new baking soda refridgerator pack at the bottom of the pail once a week to get rid of the nasty smell.,[]
I cannot continue to hold my breath when I change the pail-let alone let my poor son sleep in the same room with those toxic fumes!I am shopping around for a new pail....God help me!,[]
The Diaper Champ was a great invention.,[]
No special bags and easy to use one handed.,[]
You just put in regular garbage bags (fits like a glove) and empty as you would your regular garbage.,[]
"NO smells, NO Mess, NO problem.",[]
It's a must have!,[]
i bought this for my now 6 month old son and its very easy to use- you dont have to get any special bags or anything.,[]
(sometimes if my husband doesnt wrap up the diapers well they get caught in the hole but i guess thats more his fault than the diaper champ!),[]
it doesn't hide the dirty diaper smell though!,[]
we have it in his room which is very small as it is and you can really smell everything.,[]
i tried using odor neutralizing garbage bags and those bags that are scented and nothing works.,[]
i even tried wrapping the diapers in those skinny bags that come with your sunday newspaper and then throwing them out and it still smells.,[]
kind of disappointed--,[]
I bought this diaper pail after reading all the reviews here.,[]
Don't believe everything you read.,[]
This diaper pail has stunk up my daughters room as well as the whole floor.,[]
I've even put a stick-up inside and that doesn't help the smell.,[]
It is gross!!,[]
!,[]
A received a Diaper Genie for a shower gift with my first child and after using it for 2 weeks it began to stink!,[]
"I bought a second one a year later, 2 weeks later it began to stink!",[]
I thought that's just the way these things are.,[]
NOT SO!!,[]
I purchaced a Diaper Champ and now tell all my friends about how much better their house can smell.,[]
I never smell it!,[]
The best part is that it uses regular kitchen size bags!,[]
This is one of the best products for the nursery!,[]
I started out with a Diaper Champ and to no fault but my own I needed to get a new diaper pail.,[]
So I thought Id try the Diaper Genie.,[]
I gave it a try and I hated it.,[]
Its going back and I am buying a new Diaper Champ.,[]
I love the height of this product and the flip handle to empty the diaper into the pail.,[]
It also holds the smell in.,[]
"I only gave it 4 stars b/c - Yes it does smell when u need to empty it, but I use clinch glad bags, so as soon as i pull it out i close it and the smell is gone, spray alittle and ur good to go.I love this product - since I have tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie - I would recommend and buy this product for everyone I know.",[]
I have been using the diaper champ for a month now and am extremely satisfied.,[]
This is my second child and with my first we used a diaper genie.,[]
The genie became smelly way before it was time to empty it.,[]
Even with regular cleaning it still absorbed the bm smell.,[]
I like the fact that the diaper champ is enclosed well and the changing with regular garbage bags is much simpler than the genie.,[]
I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.,[]
I read that the diaper champ was highly recommended in the American Baby magazine.,[]
For this reason and the price I wanted to try this product only.,[]
"I feel very happy with my choice of this product.Denise Springer, Longview, WA",[]
We are extremely happy with this unit so far.,[]
Very easy to use and keeps the stench inside of the pail.No diaper pail is going to eliminate all odors.,[]
The fact of the matter is dirty diapers stink.,[]
"But the design of this pail is that the bag is never exposed to the outside air, thus all that stink get kept inside.",[]
"The only time you get the odor is when changing the bags, since you have to open the pail.",[]
"The design is such that it can be opened so the bag contents are not exposed, but the smell is much better than just throwing the diapers in an open garbage can.My only ding is that it is tough to tell when the thing is full until it is completely full.",[]
This is the only diaper pail we've had and our son is now 2.,[]
We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it's olfactory-blunting performance even more.,[]
"For especially messy and stinky diapers, I'll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it's not!",[]
I haven't even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol'd it in 2 years.,[]
Did I really just admit that?!?,[]
"We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.",[]
"If there's ever a smell in the nursery, it's from the dipaer's presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.",[]
"My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).",[]
"Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I'd recommend it to anyone!",[]
Works great - no smells.,[]
LOVE that it uses regular garbage bags.,[]
Easy to change and keep clean.,[]
Great option instead of the Diaper Genie that requires special bags and is so wasteful since it wraps each diaper in plastic.,[]
"We chose the Diaper Champ over everything else becasue we did not want to pay the money for the bags and we loved the fact that we could use regular garbage bags, great savings when you have a new baby.",[]
"Well that worked fine for the first year and the only complaint was that sometimes it was hard to get it to flip right, but not really a big deal.",[]
When our daughter was taken off of formula her diaper smell changed and unfortunately the pail did not get tougher to control the smell.,[]
We changed her pail twice a week and washed it out every time we changed it but it was not the pail that stunk it was not air sealed tightly enough and caused her room and our entire house to smell bad.,[]
Finally enough was enough and we went and bought soemthing else.,[]
I hate the fact that I had to buy two different pails but I have to say it did work well for the first year but unfortunately the diapering age lasts for longer than that and if we had to do it all over again we would go with something that would last the entire diapering age.,[]
Why spend money on a bucket when every house as one.,[]
This was the worst investment I have ever made.,[]
If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.,[]
Please do not make the same mistake as I.,[]
Go for the Neat.,[]
This pail works great for us.,[]
No ... bags to buy - any bag will do.,[]
No oder problems at all.,[]
We love it's simple design.,[]
Definitely recommend.,[]
I bought this a few weeks ago to replace the Fisher Price diaper pail we had that did not work.,[]
"The FP diaper pail seemed to absorb the odors in the actual plastic and started to smell awful even after soaking in bleach, cleaners, lysol etc.",[]
"Anyway, so far we are very happy with this one.",[]
It uses regular trash bags (saves money on refills!),[]
and my toddler can't seem to figure out how to get it open!,[]
YAAAA!,[]
We haven't noticed any odor yet.,[]
"It holds a lot and is easy for my husband and I to figure out but hard for my son to operate, which is perfect.",[]
The only concern I have (thank goodness it hasn't happened yet...) is whether or not my toddler will start to mimick us using it for his diapers and put his stuff in it (toys etc) when we aren't looking.,[]
"He's at that age where he is repeating everything and we are afraid he will start trying to ""dispose"" of his things in it.",[]
Has this happened to anyone else?,[]
"It started out ok, but the ring that seals the rotating drum catches as you try to actuate the handle.",[]
It gets so bad that the product hardly works.,[]
"Baby Trend claims that it is an assembly issue and provides directions to take it apart to fix it, but that doesn't work.",[]
It's the outside of the ring that gets hung up.,[]
Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.,[]
"If you don't want to buy refills, get yourself a garbage can and empty it often.",[]
We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product- the ability to use any garbage bag as opposed to diaper genie bags.,[]
"After all as new parents, we don't really have the luxury of time- secondly, my sister-in-law had the diaper genie and although it does seal odors, the bag tends to unravel when you put the diapers in it.",[]
"The Diaper champ ALSO seals odours and the regular garbage bags are sturdier.- Finally, I looked at the instructions to assemble both products and the diaper champ is a lot easier (ok, so we're talking about relatively easy items to assemble, but even so, the diaper champ is easier to assemble)",[]
We got the Diaper Champ as a gift and immediately fell in love with it.,[]
I wish I had invented this product.,[]
It is one of our Top 10 items to buy.It takes regular kitchen trash bags and is really quite good about the smell.,[]
"Now that we are introducing Isabella to more foods we are finding that it does not contain the smell as well, but better than anything else that we use.The only problem I run into this that it gets stuck on the inside from time to time at the worst possible moment -- stinky full diaper that needs to disappear right now!",[]
I am pregnant again so these smells get to me.,[]
Because of this problem I gave it 4 stars.It gets stuck from an occasional diaper sticky tab sticking to the inside .,[]
"When this happens, you have open everything up and it can get a little messy if the tab was stuck in the wrong placeWe also own a Diaper Genie which is 99% smell proof, but also has it's own problems.",[]
"I would only buy this one, even if money, space and smell were not an issue.",[]
Just be sure to empty at least every other day.,[]
There's no odor just a bit of a design flaw the center piece doesn't always go down on it's own sometimes and I have to physically push the diapers in - ICK - otherwise great,[]
I bought this diaper pail just before my son was born almost a year ago.,[]
I have to say that I love this product!!,[]
I like the fact that you can use tall kitchen garbage bags and you don't have to buy their bags.,[]
This pail keeps in most of the stinky smells.,[]
I do how ever put in some Armour hammer carpet room Deodorizer and all of the smell is gone.,[]
With my first child I bought several pails and nothing compares to the Diaper Champ,[]
I registered for this instead of the Diaper Genie because of the reviews.,[]
It has been great.,[]
"I recommended it to my sister, and she complained that it was stinky--found out she HAD NOT read the instructions and was not loading and removing the bags properly.",[]
"Now, she loves it as well.",[]
i love how easy the diaper champ is to use but it smells so bad i had to move it out of babies room.,[]
it is also easy to buy bags for since it uses regular trash bags!,[]
We bought this because it was recommended by Consumer Reports and I certainly regret it!,[]
It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.,[]
Its probably better to stick with the Diaper Genie.,[]
From a first time mom and dad: When reviewing multiple products for diaper disposal I knew I didn't want the added hassle and unneccessary expense of special liners and was extremely happy when I discovered the Diaper Champ.,[]
It works like a charm and we have no problems with odor.,[]
Our practice is to spray Oust in the pail each time we empty it and we empty routinely every 3 days.,[]
The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!,[]
"We love it and highly, highly recommend it.",[]
"This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!",[]
Everytime you flip the handle you get a whiff of what is underneath!,[]
Which would be dirty diapers!,[]
If you dont empty it everyday the scent lingers!,[]
"It is not just my sensitive nose, but this thing can really stink up a room.",[]
"I clean it every 2 days with Clorox Clean up, Oust odor spray, and put a citrus stick up inside , and it STILL knocks me out with letting the stench escape!",[]
"I have used this product for 7 weeks, and Im ready to put it out in the garage and use it as the downstairs ""diaper pail"" NOT IN THE HOUSE  it stinks too bad!",[]
The diaper Champ is not such a knockout!,[]
IM heading for the genie!!!!!!!,[]
!,[]
"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT THE CONVIENCE OF THE PAIL IS GREAT, AND UP UNTIL MY DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS IT WAS OK!",[]
"BUT NOW THAT SHE IS EATING SOLIDS, UUUGHHH!",[]
"WAIT BEFORE EVERYONE GETS ALL DEFENSIVE, I CHANGE THE PAIL ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK OK MAYBE I COULD CHANGE IT MORE OFTEN BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT STINKS!!!",[]
I HATE IT!,[]
I HAVE EVEN SOAKED THE PAIL IN BLEACH THEN AGAIN IN AMMONIA AND THE STINK WILL NOT COME OUT!,[]
"I HAVE TRIED SCENTED BAGS, I HAVE TRIED GLAD TRASH WITH NO LUCK!",[]
"ALSO, I CONSIDER MY SELF NEROTIC ABOUT BEING CLEAN  SO I WILL END WITH THIS FOR NEWBORNS IT IS GREAT, THE CONVIENCE THE ODOR, BUT NOW FORGET IT!!!",[]
GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS TO ALL THE NEW PARENTS!,[]
:),[]
I am very happy with the two Diaper Champs I purchased thorugh Amazon!,[]
They came in very good condition and in a very timely manner.,[]
Thank you!,[]
DB,[]
I bought the diaper champ because I didn't like the diaper genie.,[]
"The Diaper Champ is larger easier to use and empty, But when it came to the smell, it failed.",[]
"It is not as bad as if I were to throw the diapers in with the regular garbage, but the area all around the diaper champ has a constant odor.",[]
My mother used to have a home daycare and her diaper pail stunk!,[]
When I was pregnant I feared having one like that.,[]
I got the Diaper Champ as a gift and I love it!!,[]
"I just wanted one that didn't need specific refils, any trash bags will do, and I ended up with an odor-free pail too!",[]
!,[]
We bought this after reading all the Rave reviews and wanted to use kitchen bags rather than expensive refills.,[]
The lid jammed 75% of the time or fell into the container with the soiled diapers.,[]
NASTY.,[]
We got the diaper dekor plus.,[]
It rocks.,[]
Much more sanitary and easy to use.,[]
I am puzzled by reviewers who give this thing 5 stars...,[]
"Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn't want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!",[]
I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.,[]
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).,[]
You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.,[]
The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it's TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!,[]
"Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.",[]
When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.,[]
"I'd do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I'd still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can't expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)",[]
This is our third daiper disposal unit and the one feature I like most about the Daiper Champ is that it uses a standard kitchen garbage bag.,[]
"Many of the diaper disposal cans use propriatary bags that increase to cost of ownership, The Daiper Champ is easy to use and keeps the oders well contained.",[]
This contraption has been wonderful for my wife and I.,[]
"Roll up the dipe, put it in the hole, flip the handle and done.",[]
"No mess, no stink, no mechanical failures.I think the very best thing about the Champ is that we use the plastic grocery bags or wal-mart bags.",[]
They work perfectly.UPDATE: 6 years and 2 boys and this thing is still in our house.,[]
"No problems, works just like the day we got it.",[]
It will be retired soon!,[]
YAY for us!,[]
But definitely one of those must have items for new children.,[]
"Looking back, would I have gone with a different product?",[]
Not a chance.,[]
"When we were going through things to put on our baby registry, I had a hard time deciding between this and the diaper genie.",[]
"I didn't know anything about the Diaper Champ, but I had friends who had diaper genie's for their nurseries.",[]
"I'd always gotten frustrated with the twisting mechanism on the genie, but we ended up deciding we'd put both on our registry and see which we ended up with.",[]
We ended up with the Diaper Champ and we're so glad we did.Our daughter is now three months old and we have been really happy with the Diaper Champ.,[]
It's so easy to operate... a one-handed operation as opposed to the diaper genie which I never found easy.,[]
"We use the odor reducing kitchen bags in it and that seems to be a good choice... only time we smell anything is changing it.Probably my only minor ""issue"" with it (I won't say complaint, because it's not really a problem) is that as it starts to get full the diapers tend to bunch up at the top.",[]
"Of course if you empty every couple days as you should anyway, this isn't really an issue.Diaper Champ is definitely the way to go!",[]
I got this right before I had my little boy in May of this year.,[]
"I know that diaper smells ""evolve"" and become worse as baby grows, but honestly this seems to work really well.",[]
"My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.","[('diaper', 0.17884978440149207)]"
"I'll update the review if need be later on down the road, but it seems fine.",[]
I have a two month old.,[]
"I've tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie for two months now.Bottom line:If cost is important to you...get the Diaper ChampIf smell is important to you...get the Diaper GenieThe design of the Diaper Champ does not prevent smell as well as the Diaper Genie PERIOD.If you see a review here that touts that the Diaper Champ doesn't smell, then laugh at them.",[]
"They probably have a dog and think that it and their house don't smell because of the dog either.YES, the Diaper Genie costs more over the life because of their bags.",[]
SO WHAT.,[]
I really wanted to like this product.,[]
I know a lot of people do.,[]
"Plus, my friend told me diaper champs, genies, etc.",[]
were a waste of money so I wanted to prove him wrong.,[]
"My child is only about a month old now so the diapers are still small and the ""loads"" inside don't smell horrible-yet.",[]
"My biggest problem is that when we used the product, you can never tell how full it is.",[]
"And undoubtedly, when you want it to work the best, it's already full and it won't push the diapers through correctly.",[]
"Now don't get me wrong, I don't expect anything to hold a weeks worth of diapers.",[]
I was trying to replace the bags every couple of days.,[]
"But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.",[]
"Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.",[]
And when it's full-or getting there-the plunger doesn't push the diapers down and you need to manually stick your hand into it to push diapers through which can be a trick/gross operation.,[]
My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.,[]
"They're well built, will still serve a purpose once the kid gets older, have a flip top so I don't need to have a hand free to use it, they hold more, and allows me to gauge visually how full it is.",[]
It's more costly but was a better option in my nursery.,[]
Bottom line: diapers smell in anything you put them in.,[]
You might as well find the product that's going to best suite your needs in the long haul and won't let you down during a 3am diaper change.,[]
"We bought this for our ""surprise"" little girl.",[]
We had previuosly used the genie.,[]
The genie because a problem with refills and odors.,[]
This champ is a champ no odors easy to use - you don't have to give the grandparents a lessen in its use!Two years into this peice and the recommendatiuon is still a five!,[]
"We've been using this diaper pail for three months now and we couldn't be happier with it (I mean, as happy as you can be with a diaper pail!).",[]
"We use it for our daughter's cloth Fuzzi Bunz, and line it with the yellow diaper bag that Fuzzi Bunz retailers sell.",[]
"When it's time to wash the diapers, we pull out the bag, turn it inside out, and throw it into the washing machine with the diapers.",[]
"Once a week or so for my edification, I wipe the pail down with a baby wipe and spray it with a little Lysol and we haven't had an odor problem yet!",[]
When our daughter was born we bought the diaper genie and it soon became another unused thing in our closet.,[]
"I found it so impractical, because no matter what it says it is never truely one hand operable.",[]
And it takes so long to stuff and twist that the baby is neglected on the changing table for a longer period of time.,[]
"Also, it didn't hold very many diapers and was a pain to unload.",[]
I would rather just walk each diaper outside!,[]
So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that's when we found the diaper champ.,[]
I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!,[]
I know she will convert to this one.,[]
"I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.",[]
All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.,[]
No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!),[]
just let gravity do it's thing.,[]
It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.,[]
Plus there are no special bags!,[]
"Not only a money saver, but no need to worry about running out.",[]
"I just use our kitchen trash bags, and they work great.",[]
We love this diaper pail.,[]
It is so easy to use and looks nice in my sons room.,[]
We bought this diaper pail because we didn't want to hassel with special bags.,[]
"However, as my son began to ate solid foods his diapers began to change.",[]
"The odor initally was a problem, but we have since solved it.",[]
I now use the odor free trash bags and haven't had a problem since.,[]
I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.,[]
"We would recommend this, but with the use of odor free trash bags.",[]
"They don't cost more than regular bags and since you still need to use a bag, there really is no hassel.",[]
After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap.,[]
"Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don't have to worry about the &quot;squish&quot; factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time.","[('quot', 0.0963824864730069)]"
"Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain.",[]
I still think it was worth it to buy this one!,[]
"we live in FLA (heat, humidity, mediocre plumbing, lousy trash pick-up) with 3 indoor cats (alligators) and need a way to dispose of and store a weeks+ worth of cat litter.",[]
"This baby solved it, hardly any smell at all, clean, neat, no embarrassing spills out front (eww), no expensive ""sausage bags"" (the larger ones from Target, etc.",[]
work great).,[]
"forget diapers, get it for the kittys!",[]
I got Diaper gennie as a gift but I returned it to the store because I thought that it will cost a lot of money to buy the special refill plastic bag for it.,[]
"We found this DIAPER CHAMPS at the store, the price is cheaper and we can use any plastic bag to use it and we thought why not we buy it.. it's nothing to loose anyway since we have a store credit from the Gennie's refunded.",[]
"Once our baby was born and we used it, we LOVE this product so much.",[]
"It's odor Free, easy to use and the price is less than others.It's really worth for every penny that you spend for this product",[]
Love the diaper champ.,[]
"Its great that it takes any kind of trash bags and we have not noticed any odors,  The only problem that we have is that the diapers will sometimes get stuck in the shoot.",[]
"When our daughter was born she had a terrible digestive problem and had anywhere from 10-19 (YES, 19) poopy diapers a DAY!",[]
I was so thankful we had purchased the Diaper Champ.,[]
"If we had gone with another product, the disposable bags alone would have broke us!",[]
"We use every day garbage bags and to eliminate any odor when she has a really stinky diaper, we buy small scented diaper &quot;trash bags&quot;.",[]
"Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!",[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lever to open the pail (when you're going to empty it) is sometimes hard to unlatch.,[]
I bought the Diaper CHamp because the old diaper pail broke.,[]
I read some of the online reviews and decided to give it a try.,[]
It works well and uses regular trash bags - no need for expensive bags.,[]
My only problem with it is that it really does STINK!!,[]
I had to take it out of the baby's room.,[]
I am constantly spraying Lysol on it and Oust around it trying to remove the smell from the room.,[]
And I just changed the bag yesterday!,[]
"I am seriously thinking of going and buying something else, or potty training early!",[]
Well worth the money!!!!,[]
No bag refills to buy-- just use a regular handled trash bag!,[]
"Easy to empty, still using it after 2 years!!!",[]
"Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!",[]
Definately recommend!,[]
Much better than the Diaper Genie!,[]
No expensive cartridges!,[]
Big shopping bags with handles(from grocery stores or shopping stores) work best.,[]
Easy to empty and no odor.,[]
New babies are hard enough without worrying about a diaper pail.,[]
I have used this for 11 months and I love it.,[]
What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags.,[]
So easy!,[]
Never an odor problem.,[]
"And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead.",[]
I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!,[]
I purchased this diaper pail after reading the reviews on this site.,[]
I love everything about this diaper pail except that IF IT HAS A  ...DIAPER IN IT THE WHOLE ROOM SMELLS ...,[]
Anyone who thinks this thing contains the smell probably thinks they never leave a smell in the bathroom themselves.,[]
Now I have to buy a diaper pail that works.,[]
"As someone who has either tried or knows someone who has tried ALL of the diaper systems out there, I will tell you that this one is by far the easiest and most convenient.",[]
I've been using it for over 9 months and the ONLY time the nursery smells is when I'm changing the bag.,[]
"A little tip: every time you change the bag (every 2-3 days in my case), take a bottle of Lysol and spray down the Diaper Champ.",[]
It kills germs and freshens up any odors that may (but probably won't be) trapped inside.,[]
"Additionally, how much more convenient can it get to be able to use REGULAR trash bags?",[]
BUY THIS ONE!,[]
!,[]
I have used my Diaper Champ for a little over a year.,[]
I was taken in by the fact that I could use grocery bags instead of continually purchasing liner refills.,[]
The Champ worked great for only a small while.,[]
"As your children grow, the Champ will be very little help in controlling odor, which is the sole reason I purchased a diaper pail instead of a garbage can.",[]
"I change the pail every two days, sometimes every day due to the odors it fails to control.",[]
I have begun to individually wrap up each smelly diaper before putting it into the diaper pail.,[]
"Otherwise, my son's room would constantly smell.",[]
"I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.",[]
Consider the Diaper Dekor or Neat Disposal System instead.,[]
I've read great reviews on both.,[]
"I was nervous, being a first time mom, about the dirty diaper smell.",[]
I was afraid I would drive everyone out of the house.,[]
When company would come over I was terrified that when they went upstairs to see my daughter...all they would smell was dirty diapers!,[]
Well after I got the Diaper Champ my worries are gone.,[]
The only time I smell anything is when I open the cover to empty the bag.,[]
Thanks Baby Trend for this awesome product!,[]
!,[]
We are using our diaper champ for our second baby.,[]
We only have one tiny complaint.,[]
If you don't do the diaper wrap and adhear the sticky tabs back to the diaper they can get caught when you flip it over.,[]
But that is the only drawback.,[]
"This has been in continuous use for the past 2 and a half years, and there is NO smell to it what so ever!!",[]
We use scented bags purchaced at KMart.,[]
Maybe once or twice a month I spray it with Lysol and leave it outside in the sun for a couple of hours.,[]
We have NEVER had a stinky diaper pail.,[]
"***Update***New baby is almost a year old now, Diaper Champ still doesn't stink!",[]
!,[]
We have triplets and bought this pail because it holds a lot of diapers.,[]
We have always emptied the pail daily because it gets full and the ODOR IS UNBEARABLE !!!,[]
"Please note, we always use the small individual bags to tie up poopy diapers before putting them into the Champ.",[]
"We clean the Champ regularly with antibacterial wipes, spray with Lysol daily, and occasionally clean it with bleach.",[]
"As long as the pail is open and empty, there is no odor.",[]
But as soon as we close the lid and add some diapers it begins to smell bad again.,[]
"This is our second Diaper Champ and we've had the same problem with both: they don't contain the odor, even with proper cleaning.",[]
"After one year of use, the seal partially came out on both Champs .",[]
"Then, the seal adhesive sticks to the diapers so they don't always drop into the bag.",[]
Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.,[]
I don't plan to buy another Champ and would not recommend it to anyone else.,[]
This is by far the best choice I made when registering.,[]
"Everyone said I needed a genie, but this one was more appealing since it uses regular trash bags.",[]
No new mom needs another thing to run out of!!,[]
This thing is the best.,[]
No odor and it is very easy to use and change.,[]
"Simply put, the Diaper Champ is much easier to use, less expensive, and most importantly, MUCH better at keeping those odors locked away when compared to the Diaper Genie.",[]
"Even the smell of my niece's ""soy diapers"" don't seep through this.",[]
I have been thoroughly impressed -- even the nurses at the hospital where I had my baby recommended it.,[]
I love my Diaper Champ.,[]
My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it.,[]
It's simple to use and is cost efficient.,[]
The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want.,[]
"As far as some people saying it smells, I haven't had a problem.",[]
Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away.,[]
"I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!",[]
"I originally received the Genie for a shower gift and didn't know of the ""the champ"" until I saw it at a girlfriend's house... How easy!?",[]
and no extra cost for bags!,[]
Perfect.,[]
The ONLY drawback is the occasional smell which we've remedied by individually bagging the poopy diapers.,[]
"There is a great item at Bed Bath and Beyond that holds grocery bags for you... so, we purchased one of those, mounted it to our wall next to the diaper champ and we're set!",[]
"Seriously, it holds more than the genie and it is sooo cost effective.",[]
"Not to mention, just plain easier!",[]
the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.,[]
of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time (which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores!,[]
"), but i never had any issues with smell, unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway.",[]
"what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others, is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it, meaning grocery bags, trash bags... nothing fancy.",[]
as a new mom (or new parent) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags.,[]
no complaints from me on this diaper pail.,[]
I would recommend this product to anyone with a few hundred dirty diapers in their future.,[]
It works wonderfully at preventing odors.,[]
"We have it in our bedroom, where we end up changing our one month old most frequently, and you'd never guess it was there.",[]
I particularly appreciate the fact that you can use any type of bag with the diaper champ.,[]
We just use our regular kitchen garbage bags which has saved us both time and money.,[]
I love this product.,[]
"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers, and it doesn't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers.",[]
"It lasts me about 2 days.... 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor, other than when you open it, but that is inevitable.Infact, the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their &quot;mother's room&quot;.",[]
That seems to say alot!And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run... no special bags to buy... what a pain that seems to me.,[]
I use plain old garbage bags... or even very large shopping bags.Great product.,[]
"ALL DIAPERS SMELL, no matter what you put them in, especially once your kid starts solid foods.",[]
Get over it.,[]
This pail is fantastic.,[]
"We use it for our dogs' poop bags, and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags (we use vanilla, they also have lavender, and they are cheap).",[]
"There is no smell, except in the summer when it is hot (and that's only because the pail is outside on the back porch, the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning).",[]
I agree it's better than the genie.,[]
I own the genie and served us well.,[]
"But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.",[]
"It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.",[]
"I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.",[]
"Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.",[]
I love the diaper champ.,[]
I registered for this item because I liked the fact that it takes regular garbage bags.,[]
"When it's almost full it tends to have a bit of an odor, but lysol takes care of that, and helps kill germs.",[]
This is very easy to use and is simple to change.,[]
I highly recommend the diaper champ.,[]
The Diaper Champ was one of the best shower gifts we recieved!,[]
We have been using it for our son for 3 months now and it works fantastically.,[]
It is easy to use and convenient that it uses regular garbage bags (no running out of refills at a crutial moment) and more economical.,[]
It does need to be changed when you notice it is not working as smoothly.,[]
"The only thing I don't like about it is it is difficult to open (I have broken several nails), but if that isn't important to you or you have someone else who can open it for you it is an exceptional product that I would recommend to anyone.",[]
"I registered for this product, because I did not want to spend money on buying refills for it.",[]
"I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.",[]
"The only drawback would be that sometimes the diapers get stuck when you try to turn it, because of the tape and also the wipes if you throw those away by themselves.",[]
This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.,[]
"However, I never use it.",[]
It's so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.,[]
We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.,[]
10 stars out of 5!!!,[]
"My wife and I, rookies, went back and forth about what to get to manage the inevitable dirty diaper situation.",[]
"We did our homework, and pre-baby planning and purchasing (you're welcome Babies R Us).",[]
"We originally purchased a diaper genie, but that twisting thing, the pricey refills, those sausage-diaper links...it all was a bit much.",[]
"Read the reviews, drank the punch, and got the Diaper Champ.",[]
We're true converts!!!,[]
"The one- handed, heck, one-finger operation of this thing is soooo much better than the Genie.",[]
"I am now ready to compete in the diaper changing event in the next olympics.This is super fast, super simple, and so good we got a second one for the playpen/changing area downstairs.",[]
The double garbage bag tip has helped with the smell.,[]
"Oh the days of the breast milk poopy diaper...how I miss them so....New Slogan....In the Land of the Dirty Diaper, The Diaper Champ is KING!!!",[]
!,[]
I registered for this pail dispite a few bad reviews.,[]
It's easy to use and the best thing about it is you can use any old bag without having to buy specific ones!,[]
"The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.",[]
Would reccomend to anyone.,[]
Plus there's no smell at all!,[]
We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail.,[]
"And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one.",[]
"While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!!",[]
So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.,[]
"Oh well, I'd still recommend it.",[]
You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well.,[]
And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in.,[]
"As a first-time Mom I had no idea how many ""baby items"" I would need/want for my new baby.",[]
We thought it would be a good idea to register for a diaper pail since we didn't relish the idea of stinky diapers in the house.,[]
"The diaper Genie looked like a good option, and I knew a couple of moms who had them and loved them.",[]
"Still, having to buy special bags for it on top of all the new monthly expenses we would incur from having a new member of the family just wasn't a feasible option for us.So we got the Diaper Champ.",[]
We were so happy with it for the first 8 months or so.,[]
My son was totally breastfed and didn't start solids until he was 6 months old.,[]
The Diaper Champ didn't stink at ALL during that time.,[]
"Fool that I was, I didn't even think about doing any maintainence to it other than changing the bag when it was full.",[]
"But it definitely needs to be wiped down and aired out at least once a week or every other week depending on your smell problem.One of the other posters mentioned that they got the smell to go away after cleaning and airing it out, but the smell kept coming back.",[]
That has been my experience as well.,[]
I don't know if it was just because I wasn't cleaning it regularly from the beginning or if the plastic has the unfortunate flaw of holding onto odors (like tupperware tends to do).,[]
"Still, I have been happy with this product and think it was wonderful for the beginning of my son's life before his diapers got really stinky.",[]
The Diaper Champ in our house will have to work overtime in July now that we have baby #2 on the way.,[]
"Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.",[]
It will just take a commitment from moms and dads to do regular cleaning of it and to change the bag frequently to keep the smells in check.,[]
"I rarely write reviews or comments, however after purchasing yet another Diaper Champ, I decided to add my two cents for this product.",[]
"Firstly, I am not a parent, altho I hope to be someday soon.",[]
"I am, however, an Uncle to many many children of dear friends and family.",[]
"And the first gift I send upon the announcement of a new born on-the-way is the Diaper Champ - yes, it's my default baby gift.",[]
"I would like to add that I used to give the Genie but after learning that the great thing about the Diaper Champ is the flexibility of bags that it houses - very important upon emergency - it was a no-brainer... Once, a friend's wife was somewhat unappreciative of my offering - she's of the HM type - and thot I should've given something more glamorous.",[]
That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.,[]
I immediately received a call with a sincere apology and was blessed enough to never need another visit to a church again.,[]
"My reiteration that altho ""this gift ain't sexy, you may just name your next child after me for it,"" may yet hold true.",[]
"Other than that one time, I've never heard anything other than praise for the Champ.",[]
Two couples even bought extras after they had twins...,[]
"The only CON to this product that from now on, whenever my friends see ""ka-ka,"" they'll think of me... Could be worse I guess.",[]
love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.,[]
way cheaper than others.,[]
have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.,[]
We bought this 3 years ago for my son when he was born in an effort to avoid the more expensive Diaper Champ and to avoid having to buy special bags for it.,[]
This was a mistake.,[]
"After my son started eating solid foods, the smell was horrible!",[]
"Despite keeping Lysol nearby, my husband and I were always arguing over who would take the bag out when it was full.",[]
"Several times I took it outside and cleaned it with clorox to get rid of the smell, but it only returned.",[]
"We're now expecting again, and this time we're going with the Diaper Genie!",[]
"Though it doesn't smell as you are filling it, watch out when you go to change the bag.",[]
"The smell is so strong I can't stomach it and my husband has to step in.I do think it is much easier to use then the diaper genie, but someone needs to come up with a deadorizer.",[]
I have been using the Diaper Champ for over 16 months now with excellent results.,[]
"My toddler has been on solid foods for 6 months now, so you can only imagine the smell that exudes from his diaper after he has a bowel movement.",[]
"Shortly after that diaper makes it into the Diaper Champ, the smell is gone and stays that way.",[]
"We change the bag once a week now, since it doesn't fill up as fast, and still no bad smells linger in my nursery.",[]
Even my odor sensitive mother who babysits for us on a regular basis says that the lack of odor is surprising.,[]
"As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.",[]
"A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.",[]
"UPDATE: The new Diaper Champ opens easier and has a larger opening... they corrected the two biggest issues!XXXXXXXXXXIf your biggest issue is smell, then this is the pail for you.",[]
It is the only pail I found where you are never in contact with the diapers already in the pail when you add another one.,[]
"The mechanism on top is a barrier between you and the diapers already in the pail...love it.Also, this pail works great with disposable OR cloth diapers!Only complaints...1.",[]
Size - I really wish it held more.,[]
"The narrow neck (that keeps the stink out) means that when it starts getting full, you have to change it right away or it won't work.",[]
I wish they'd made it a little bigger.2.,[]
Latch- The latch you must lift to change the bag is awful...a real nail breaker!,[]
"Be forewarned.If these two items were fixed, it would be a five star pail.",[]
"Still, compared with what else is out there, this is my favorite.",[]
It keeps the stink out for my now one-year-old twins!,[]
"I had originally registered for the Diaper Genie (it seems to be the most well known), and then I changed my registery after speaking with friends who already had babies and had tried it.",[]
Friends told me how difficult it was to drop the diapers in the Genie and also complained about buying the refills as well as the odor.,[]
"After reading customer reviews on various sites for the Diaper Champ, I decided to give this pail a try.",[]
"My daughter, Alyssa, is now five months old, and I could not be happier with this diaper pail.",[]
"It is extremely easy to use and there is no added cost for special refills, simply use your kitchen garbage bags.",[]
It has also passed the most important test - it really does contain the odor.,[]
"The only time that it smells is when I open it to change the bag, which is about twice a week.",[]
There have also been a couple of times when the pail has filled up to the top and a slight odor is in the air letting me know that it's time for a bag change.,[]
I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.,[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
This works really well.,[]
I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.,[]
You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.,[]
You end up saving in the long run.,[]
The Diaper Champ is great.,[]
"I originally received the Diaper Genie as a baby shower gift and at first it worked well, but after a while it really started to get an odor.",[]
"Plus, having to buy the separate bags was beginning to be a pain.",[]
One of my girlfriends introduced me to the Diaper Champ and I love it!,[]
"There is no odor and it takes your everyday trash bags and it holds more diaper so it doesn't have to be emptied as often.It is too bad others have had bad reviews, they must not be using it correctly.",[]
I used to live in an apartment basement with NO WINDOWS and this 'stroke of genius' diaper champ did not smell at all!,[]
I ended up not even having to wash out the inside until 4mnths later!,[]
Sounds gross I know but that's how awesome it really is!,[]
AND it's super easy to use and you don't have to buy bag refills.,[]
Need I say more?,[]
"When we first thought about a diaper pail, we dreaded it.",[]
All we heard about was the Diaper Genie and how great it was until I talked with my sister who turned me on to the 'Champ!',[]
She has a Genie and was told about the Champ.,[]
"You use your own bags, it's bigger, and it's virtually odor free.",[]
The only time that it smells is when we need to change it and then the odor is gone as soon as you take the bag out and put a new one in.,[]
No fancy extra bags to buy and no twisting.,[]
Fabulous!,[]
Yet another product to endorse.,[]
My mom had 11 children and I was very familiar with the diaper genie.,[]
It was good for smell but what I didnt like was having to buy refill bags.,[]
Also the long snake that was akward to take out when pail was full and the cutter sometimes didnt work.,[]
When I had my first baby we chose the diaper champ because we are a very low budget family and I couldnt see how we could always afford diapers let alone refill bags for the pail.,[]
After reading reviews I was satisfied with smell comments.,[]
When I purchased it I found that it did smell though mostly only when you opened it.,[]
It only smells closed when it is really full.,[]
I found emptying it often and spraying lysol each time (also in the empty bag) really makes a difference.,[]
Overall it doesnt smell when closed when you follow these simple hygiene steps,[]
I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading many reviews for several different diaper pails.,[]
This is by far the easiest product to use.,[]
There are no complicated bag systems and no special replacement bags.,[]
I have not had the problem of having any oppressive odors leak out into the room.,[]
The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.,[]
"There is no such thing as a completely odorless plastic diaper pail since plastic absorbs odors, but just drop a couple of dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) into the bottom of the diaper champ (not in the bag) and the odor disappears.",[]
This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.,[]
I would recommend this to anyone.,[]
"I was torn between the diaper champ and genie, but after reading all of the reviews, I went for the diaper champ.",[]
I'M SO GLAD I READ THE REVIEWS!!!,[]
"The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!",[]
"One reviewer mentioned a smell which I have never noticed, but I would suggest double bagging it.",[]
"You never have to take the other bag out, but maybe that's why I have never smelled anything from mine.",[]
It's SO EASY TO USE!,[]
Highly reccomend it!,[]
My 8 year old yellow lab was able to get the top of the diaper champ off and get his head stuck in the canistar.,[]
No one was home and he suffocated.,[]
This could just as easily have happend to a small child.,[]
There is no warning in the literature to prevent this type of horrible tragedy .,[]
I love it!,[]
It is easy to use and I never smell any odor coming from it.,[]
You can also use any kind of trash bag with it instead of having to buy special inserts.,[]
I Love the Diaper Champ.,[]
I am a  mother of 4 and each one had a different diaper system.,[]
One had the diaper genie (BOO!),[]
and it was not a magical experience.,[]
"In fact, it did not work for me at all and I can work almost anything!",[]
The youngest child had the Diaper Champ and it was fabulous.,[]
It was smell proof!,[]
The only time you could even remotely smell the dirty diapers was when you had to change the bag.,[]
I can and have used every type of bag for it and they all fit.The only thing I would change about the Diaper Champ would be to make it easier to open.,[]
I kept braking fingernails when I opened it to change it.,[]
We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now and still have no odor complaint.,[]
"To keep any odor out I just spray some Lysol, Oust or Febreze when I change the bags, twice a week.And the best feature of all is that you don't have to waste money on expensive bags that are going to the trash anyway.",[]
The Champ is the ultimate in Diaper disposal.,[]
We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted (2 sets of refills every month).,[]
The Diaper Champ uses regular trash bags (we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate!,[]
Simply drop the diaper in the cubby on top and flip the handle!,[]
The diaper falls into the belly of the champ and that's it!,[]
Drop and flip!,[]
"No twisting, shoving or cutting like the Genie.",[]
"And this is perfect for babies that grow into inquisitive toddlers - the Champ is much bigger than the Genie so it can't be easily hauled around by an adventurous baby and it's easy to keep her out of the messy contents as well (unlike regular diaper pails or trash cans)!Another reason I prefer the Champ is the fact that there are no ""blades"" involved.","[('champ', 0.17268949283773669)]"
I just didn't like the idea of a diaper disposal with blades in my nursery.,[]
The thought that someday she might get into the pail and possibly be cut on the sharp blades used for separating the bags - was frightening!,[]
This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.,[]
"Just simple, clean, odor resistant, in-expensive to maintain/operate and safe!I'd recommend the Champ to anyone - buy it, you won't be sorry!",[]
I have no problems with my Diaper Champ.,[]
It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.,[]
Definitely recommend,[]
What I liked:  Contained the smell.,[]
Ease of use.,[]
Takes regular garbage bags (saves money!).,[]
Great capacity (empty it out once in 7 days or so).,[]
Sturdy.,[]
Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I didn't like: Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position (could just be a problem with mine) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it.,[]
(I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend's place - didn't like it).,[]
I received this diaper champ as a gift and at first it was great.,[]
Now that my baby is 9 months old her room is starting to smell.,[]
Since the diaper champ doesn't individually wrap each diaper the smell starts getting bad.,[]
I would suggest you spend the extra 10 to 20 bucks and get a diaper product that individually wraps each diaper!,[]
This has been really great for about a year.,[]
Now I am looking for something else that will hold in the smell of a one year old's diapers.The function of this is very simple and easy.,[]
"Sometimes diapers do get stuck, either because the bag is full or because the diaper is not folded well.",[]
"Sometimes it is hard to fold a diaper that has leaked of you know what so I will just pop open the top and put it in that way.The odor has always been held in, until now.",[]
That's why I'm here.,[]
To look at reviews of other diaper pails to see if there is anything that will hold in the odor of a toddlers diapers.,[]
I have had to put the thing in the hall because the smell was overpowering when you opened the door to the nursery.,[]
I might just try to wrap the diapers in a small plastic bag before putting them into the Champ to see if that works.It does hold a lot!,[]
"I change my Champ about once a week, on trash day, and it holds a lot of toddler sized diapers.I have never had a Genie but went with the Champ because I didn't want the expense of buying the refills.",[]
"My friend has went through three Diaper Genies with her kids, loves them, and I have never smelled a bad smell in her nursery, but her Genie is ALWAYS full whenever I go over there.",[]
"That leads me to believe, as with reviews I have read, that it doesn't hold much.Having said that, I still think this is a good pail for the first year and I don't regret buying it.",[]
I just wish it held in the smell better once the babies get older.,[]
I have had a small smell problem but that is probably because I didn't change the bag as often as I should!,[]
"OOPs ;) Anyway, I never had any problems with it.",[]
"I would recommend this product, especially over the diaper genie because they are no refills to buy!",[]
We are first time parents but have friends who have young children.,[]
We always try to get out of spending the night at their house because the diaper pail in the spare bathroom smells so bad.,[]
We took a strangers advice (no one we knew believed in a diaper pail that didn't stink) and we purchased this product.,[]
We couldn't be happier.,[]
"At first we used it for disposable diapers which worked fine, but we were worried about how it was going to hold up when we started using cloth diapers.",[]
"Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.","[('weeks', 0.12667467482348388)]"
"We did run in to that once, it means the diaper champ is full and you need to empty it.",[]
I LIKE THIS PALE BETTER THAN THE NEAT OR THE GENIE.I HAD THE OTHER TWO AND THE COST MORE TO MAINTAIN THAN ANTHING ELSE.THE CHAMPION TAKES SMALL GARBAGE BAGS FROM THE .99 CENT STORE.SO I GET THOSE AND FILL MY GARBAGE BACK UP.ITS FAST AND EASY.AND IT SAVES YOU MONEY BECAUSE THE REFILLS FOR THE OTHER TWO PRODUCTS ARE EXPENSIVE.,[]
This diaper pail is NOT odor free.,[]
"Given what it's supposed to hold ... well, you really don't believe that, do you?That being said, this is a really wonderful product.",[]
The key for me are saving money on &quot;special bags&quot; and using regular old 13 gallon price club kitchen bags.,[]
"Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).",[]
Highly recommended.,[]
"This diaper pail stinks, literally.",[]
We purchased this one to save a few bucks.,[]
It smells within minutes with one diaper in it.,[]
We tried using scented trashbags...didn't work.,[]
It was a total waste of money.The Diaper Dekor and Diaper Dekor Plus are fabulous.,[]
You have to buy special bags but they are worth it.,[]
I'll never buy anything else again,[]
My son will be a year old this December (2003) &amp; we have been using the diaper champ since he was born.,[]
I deliberately waited a long time to write a review on this item because so many reviewers mentioned odor becoming more noticable after solids were introduced.,[]
We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.,[]
"It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.",[]
It's kind of tight &amp; if you're not careful you could break a nail.,[]
(I have short nails so it's not an issue for me.),[]
However it is so simple to just plop a diaper into the pail &amp; flip the top.,[]
That's it.,[]
Then when the pail is full you just change out the garbage bag.,[]
"I keep a box of inexpensive garbage bags in the bedroom where the baby can't get to them, but they're easy to access when I need them.As far as odor control goes, I exclusively breastfed my son for his first 9 months.",[]
"We did not have any problems at all while he was exclusively breastfed, nor are we having any now that we're slowly introducing solids.",[]
"Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.",[]
I don't even use Lysol or other sprays.We keep the champ in the master bedroom &amp; our cats litter box is in the master bathroom.,[]
The only time we have odor problems is when our cat makes a nasty stinky.,[]
I wish Baby Trend made a litter box.,[]
I wasn't going to get a diaper disposal system because I knew I did not want a new baby and then worrying about making sure I had the proper garbage bags.,[]
"But, I found the Diaper Champ and love it!",[]
It works well and I went to Costco and purchased enough bags to last until the babies in high school for under twenty bucks!,[]
"Currently, my daughter is 15 months old.",[]
"Originally, we had a Diaper Genie.",[]
My sister-in-law had mentioned that she was very happy with the Diaper Champ.,[]
"So, I went out and bought the Diaper Champ because I no longer wanted to be a slave to specialized diaper refills.",[]
It worked really well for about one month.,[]
Ever since my daugter has started eating table food (the real stuff not the baby jar food) the Diaper Champ has failed at containing the dirty diaper odors.,[]
"I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.",[]
"Also, it is a challenge to remove the lingering odor from the Diaper Champ after every bag change.It is a great design, except it does need a way to keep wayward toddlers from dumping toys into the pail.",[]
I love the idea of using garbage bags instead of constantly buying refills.,[]
"I give it a rating of 2 stars because it fails to do the most important job of a diaper pail (in my opinion), keep the the odor contained.",[]
I'm going to try to put the diapers in a ziploc to see if that solves my problem.,[]
This is by far the best diaper disposal system we have found.,[]
You don't need any special bags - we usually just buy a roll of 35 13-gallon bags from Target for 99 cents.,[]
"Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.",[]
Your odor problem will be solved.I would recommend this to everyone.,[]
I cant believe I was sent a used product!,[]
"!1) The box seemed to have been ripped by a previous owner and then was taped2) The plastic bin had scratches all over it and I found someones hair inside it!3) The dispensing unit had scratches on it!4) There was signs of the items having been cleaned up, it was oily inside the bin!5) In order to clean this you need to twist both of the knobs on its side counter clockwise... best of luck opening it.","[('scratches', 0.13252761953362815)]"
It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.,[]
This is a money saving product since you avoid having to buy those plactic bag refills.,[]
"I too, use to have it in my bedroom but moved it to the bathroom because the odor would leak out.",[]
"My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.",[]
"Even though you change the plastic bag every 2-3X a week, if you put a poo-poo diaper in there you will smell the odor.",[]
"Well thats my experience, hope that helps.",[]
We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.,[]
"It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).",[]
"It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.",[]
"As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.",[]
"For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.",[]
"Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.",[]
We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).,[]
"It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)",[]
This is a wonderful product.,[]
One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.,[]
"Right now, it's only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.",[]
We've been using the Diaper Champ for the past 8 months and love it!,[]
It's easy to use and keeps the smell it.,[]
"We change the bag 1-2 times a week even though our son has at least 1 stinky, dirty diaper per day.",[]
Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.,[]
Try it...you'll like it!,[]
"This is a great diaper pail and no, it does not omit odors....that is until the dreaded solid foods and real poops come into the picture.",[]
Sorry don't mean to be crude.,[]
I have enjoyed this product until my son started eating solids.,[]
I don't think there is a diaper pail on earth that will totally hide the smell.,[]
I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.,[]
I really liked this item mainly because you can use any bag and don't have to have the added expense of buying specific bags.,[]
Just remember...by the time the stinky diapers arrive it won't be soon before they are potty trained!,[]
I registered for the diaper genie in my first pregancy and have hated it for the last two years.,[]
"I researched and found that the diaper champ had all the cool benefits  (no extra bags, one hand toss)to be just what i needed.",[]
I have used it for 3 days so far and am just thrilled with it.,[]
I would recomend this product for moms who want to spend less time getting rid of a diaper than changing one.,[]
I think it is prudent for parents to purchase some sort of disposal system for dirty diapers.,[]
The draw to this particular model/brand is the fact that it does not require special bags.,[]
"We've had this item for 3 weeks, and so far, it works just fine.",[]
"My daughter is breastfed, so I don't have the stink problems that others have noted (although I anticipate the smell will ripen once she is weaned).",[]
"It is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to assemble.",[]
I tried to use a friend's Diaper Genie and couldn't figure out how to use it.,[]
I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].,[]
"It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).",[]
You only need one hand (so you can hold baby with the other).,[]
It contains the odor with no problem.,[]
"Best of all, it's easy to empty, just push on the blue handle with the heel of your hand (no need to break your nails...), take out the old trash bag and put in a new one.",[]
No need to worry about running out of a special refill bag like the DG.,[]
I love the Diaper Champ!,[]
"I've used both the Diaper Champ and Diaper Genie, and the Diaper Champ is the hands down winner.",[]
You don't need to buy special bags and it's easy to use (even one handed).,[]
We go through LOTS of diapers and don't have any problems with the smell in the nursery.,[]
The only thing we did was add a Stick-Up air freshener inside the pail.,[]
"The only time you can even smell the diapers a bit is when you empty the bag, but the air-freshener in the pail eliminates even that slight smell.",[]
Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!,[]
"It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!!!",[]
"It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).",[]
It's also easy to empty out.,[]
"Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.",[]
"And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!",[]
"Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!",[]
"I did a lot of research before buying a ""diaper system"" (asked friends, read other reviews on amazon, consulted baby product guides, etc.).",[]
There didn't seem to be a consensus on the best one out there.,[]
"However, I have been very happy with my Diaper Champ purchase - the stink is contained, the dirty diapers drop in easily and it uses regular kitchen bags (no special bags required like other systems).",[]
We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital.,[]
When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ.,[]
We LOVE it!!!,[]
The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell.,[]
.,[]
.impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce.,[]
He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it.,[]
"In addition, it's very easy to use.",[]
Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag.,[]
Couldn't be simpler.,[]
We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ.,[]
This is a great pail.,[]
It originally appealed to me because of the cost benefit of using any old plastic bag.,[]
We buy the generic tall kitchen bags.,[]
We soon found that another benefit is that you only have to change the bag every 6 or 7 days!,[]
"Additionally, it really has a one-handed operation.",[]
"The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.",[]
"When the diapers get bigger, or if you have a messy one that leaks a bit as it's being pushed down into the system, BEWARE.",[]
We noticed that the odor coming from the Champ was stronger than normal even when we cleaned it & it was empty.,[]
"Upon closer inspection we noticed that between the weight that pushes the diapers down, and the side of the 'chute' on the Champ, that there was quite a hidden mess.",[]
This mess was nearly impossible to clean and we were disgusted by it.,[]
"Bottom line, this wasn't bad for a little while, but after seeing (and smelling) that disgusting mess, I'm going back for the Genie, expensive bags & all.",[]
The best feature is that you can use your own garbage bags.,[]
This makes the investment in a diaper pail a one-time occurance!!,[]
The Diaper Champ works by using a piston-type chute.,[]
"You put the diaper in the chute, flip the handle, and the piston slide the diaper down into the bag below.",[]
"Nothing fancy...nothing to break!So far, it has worked great.",[]
We change the bags 1-2 times per week.,[]
"Yes, it is stinky when you remove the bag, but what do you expect?!",[]
We did put an sticky deodorant in the pail to help.,[]
I agree with previous reviews...you still have to clean the thing!,[]
"!When comparing to my sister's Diaper Genie, this is much simpler to use and costs much less over its lifetime.",[]
I bought the diaper champ when my son was born.,[]
He's now 8 months old and I still love it.,[]
"It uses regular trash bags, which is very convenient.",[]
My husband takes the trash bag out about once a week now.,[]
"At first, he only had to take it out every 2 weeks.We have really enjoyed having it and I'm getting one for all my friends who are pregnant now.",[]
"Some of the reviewers have written that it smells, but I haven't had that problem at all.",[]
"Matter of fact, the changing table butts up against it and the glider that I use daily is less than three feet away.",[]
"I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.",[]
This is one of the items that I think should be on every registry!,[]
Operating it is really easy and the same applies to emptying it.,[]
"Okay, I have read all of the reviews after posting mine when my son was only a couple of months old.",[]
Some reviews have said it gets worse after a while.,[]
"Well, my son is 9 months old and eating solid foods and still not a problem.",[]
I love this diaper champ and the price (I think it is very reasonable).,[]
If the diaper champ started to smell...I would buy another one.,[]
[money] a year for no smell doesn't bother me at all.,[]
"From what I have read in the reviews, it seems like the more you scrub it, the worse it makes it.",[]
The small lining around the weight will start to crack and the seal will be broken.,[]
"Anyway, I have never needed to clean this.",[]
Garbage bags in and out no mess anywhere.,[]
"Nothing to clean, still looks new!",[]
sometimes I will wipe the hole with a baby wipe if there is an accident.,[]
"Also, I will spray it with disinfectant spray when I change it.",[]
"But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.",[]
You shouldn't need to.,[]
Does anyone know how to roll and tape shut a dirty diaper?,[]
My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!,[]
"Good luck in your choice, hopefully you will get one that works for you.",[]
I haven't tried other pails but can say this one is fantastic!,[]
"No leaking odors, and you can use any trash bag.",[]
"I love it, don't try anything else!I ordered 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, makes diaper changes easy and odor free.",[]
"I bought this product based on reviews in ""Baby Bargains"" and also on this site.",[]
At first it worked well- no major problems.,[]
It smelled when you opened it to change the bag- but what container storing dirty diapers wouldn't?,[]
"After about 2 months of use, the smell got bad.",[]
"I had been changing the bag frequently, cleaning it, airing it out outside, and finishing that routine with Lysol.",[]
However I could smell the thing in the hall outside of my daughter's bedroom.,[]
"I changed the bag, cleaned it, etc (see my usual routine above) and it still smelled.",[]
"It wasn't even open!To make an even longer story shorter- I bought the Diaper Genie and found that all of the ""reasons"" that I didn't buy it in the first place (refills being costly/annoying) didn't even apply to me.",[]
The refills are about $5 and are available at all of the stores that I go to on a regular basis.,[]
"I've used it for about 2 months now and I can't smell anything, unless I'm emptying it and the bottom is open.",[]
"I lived in a small condo 3 years ago when my daughter was born, and we used a diaper champ for over a year.It did a good job of keeping out odors for the first several months.",[]
"But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).",[]
"Also, wrap the garbage bag around the outside rim of the diaper champ before closing the cover (similar to how you use your kitchen garbage can).",[]
"This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.",[]
"If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.",[]
I don't plan on getting another one for now.,[]
I am thinking the key is to wrap the diaper in an airtight bag.,[]
So the Genie sounds like a good idea.,[]
But I've never tried it before.,[]
"At this point, my plan is to look for some kind of cheap, small bags to wrap the upcoming diapers and just chuck it into a regular garbage can in my garage :)",[]
It holds odors pretty well.,[]
Its great to be able to use any kind of trash bag you want with it.,[]
"I do admit, older children's diapers are a bit too stinky in the diaper champ, but I never said this product was a miracle worker.",[]
I'm really happy with it and would recommend it to all of my friends and family.,[]
We are using a diaper service and use the champ to collect and contain the diapers in the nursery.,[]
The champ tends to stick about half of the time.,[]
The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.,[]
I suggest using a trash can with a tight lid.,[]
I ordered the diaper champ for my daughter who just had twins after reading some other reviews.,[]
We are very happy with it.,[]
It is easy to use and holds a lot of diapers.,[]
It is nice that it uses regular garbage bags.,[]
My other children have had a diaper genie and I could never get it to work.,[]
We were using diaper genie.,[]
"Even with the scented cartridges, Diaper Genie left an unavoidable, embarrassing rancidness (don't right rank).",[]
"Diaper Champ still holds odor, however odorous when the Diaper Champ is full.And, it is not as costly, as was the Diaper Genie to re-cartridge, because you simply have to replace the trash bag!",[]
Disposing of the diapers is so simple a child could do it and is more sturdy than Diaper Genie.,[]
"I think in the long run you want something economical, easy and excellent for diaper disposal.",[]
"Like a champ, Diaper Champ came to our rescue and knocked out any doubts that we were making a bad investment.Diaper Genie is not a genie, more like a hassle if you ask me, because it was difficult to dispose of the diapers and replace the cartridges.Oh, and the ""Champ"" is fairly easy to clean!",[]
POW!,[]
Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.,[]
"I bought the first one of these, put in one dirty diaper (baby isn't even on solids yet-- on soy formula) and it smelled up the entire nursery.",[]
"Thinking maybe mine was defective, I took it back and exchanged for a different one, and used scented trash bags.",[]
"After 30 min., I could smell the scented trash bag when I walked in the nursery, so I figured if I could smell that, then certainly a dirty diaper would smell, too.",[]
"I took it back for the second time and bought the Odorless diaper pail from Safety First, works great!",[]
I cannot understand why this product gets such good reviews.,[]
It was a waste of my time to even try it.,[]
We like that this product uses regular trash bags while still containing a lot of diapers.,[]
It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.,[]
Highly recommend this.,[]
I thought this was going to be the greatest thing EVER and it was until my son started bottle feeding and his diaper began to smell.,[]
"Now, I have to bring the dirty diapers down stairs to avoid the toxic smell.",[]
Kinda makes the diaper champ usless.,[]
This has been a fantastic diaper pail for us.,[]
"We went through a Diaper Genie with each of our first two children, and this third time, I'm so glad we tried the Diaper Champ.",[]
It has proven to be far better than the Diaper Genies.,[]
"Our baby is 7 months old now and eating solids, and the odors have not been a problem.",[]
Not buying special bags has been great.,[]
No twisting; no cutting; no blades to wear out.,[]
Wish we'd used this with our first two.,[]
I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.,[]
The Diaper Champ is easy to use and not having to buy refils is such a blessing (diapers are expensive enough).,[]
"We empty it twice and week and therefore, have no problem with it getting overly full (at least, on Size One diapers).",[]
"Odor is not a problem, except when you open the Champ, but what do you expect of an item that stores dirty diapers?",[]
A wipe-down with scented disinfecting wipes takes care of any residual odor.,[]
I squirt some scented baby powder in the bottom of the can and that helps as well.,[]
I also like that I can store extra bags in the bottom of this.,[]
"It's been worth every penny (and the extra effort I had to go to find it, since it's not carried at any place, that I could find, besides Babies R Us).",[]
We love the fact that we can use our tall kitchen garbage bags with our Diaper Champ instead of having to buy special refills like Playtex's Diaper Genie.,[]
Diaper smells are contained well.,[]
"The capacity seems to be slightly larger than the Diaper Genie, too.",[]
(Less trips outside with bags of dirty diapers equals less work for Mommy and Daddy!),[]
Wouldn't trade this diaper disposal system for any other!,[]
5 stars!!,[]
!,[]
I have ordered 3 of these for gifts and ordered another that I use for my kitty litter clumps!,[]
Works great for either purpose!,[]
Diaper Champ works great!,[]
You can use your regular garbarge bags with it.,[]
No need to buy re-fills.,[]
We have two diaper Champs--One in the babies room and one downstairs.,[]
"I must also add that we have twin daughters, so we have ""double the diapers"".",[]
We have been extremely happy with the diaper Champ.,[]
It is very easy to change the bag.,[]
"Open the canister, pull out the old bag, and replace with a new bag.",[]
"An added plus is that it takes normal trash bags so you don't have to run all over town to buy a ""special"" bag.",[]
I change the bags twice a week (On Mondays and Thursdays) and this works great---and keep in mind that this is for two babies!,[]
There is not a problem with any odors.,[]
I spray some Lysol in the canister at the time of bag changes and this is not really needed--I just do it.,[]
We are very happy with this product!,[]
!,[]
Wanted to wait for a while before providing feedback on this; was concerned that once the really smelly stuff started coming through this pail would not work.,[]
Was I wrong!!,[]
"This diaper pail is great, and it is very cost effective.",[]
"I can use inexpensive trash can bags, instead of expensive refills.",[]
Smell has come out on two occassions when I did not close the top properly.,[]
"Other than that, it has been OK.",[]
I am a first time mom and I have had an opportunity to use the diaper genie.,[]
When it was my turn to register however I registered for the diaper champ.,[]
"It was so easy and convient no twisiting, tying off etc.",[]
etc.,[]
etc.,[]
For a new mom or not this is the easiest way to get rid of diapers.,[]
The fact that you don't need any special bags makes it cost effcient for those on a budget or not.,[]
My sister-in-law had a diaper genie but when she saw the diaper champ she traded it for the diaper champ.,[]
Kudos,[]
As much as I hear you all on the Diaper Champ - it is fabulous - the SMELL factor is greatly reduced when you take the trouble to empty diapers into the lavatory first.,[]
This is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing.,[]
"Feces should NOT go into landfills because they can carry bacteria and intestinal viruses which can filter into, and contaminate, groundwater and soils.",[]
Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!,[]
Please be more conscientious!,[]
Do your part and put the poop in the pot and help to preserve our precious planet for that little person whose bottom you are currently managing.,[]
Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat.,[]
"The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that.",[]
I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.,[]
This is one of the best purchases we made.,[]
"The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!","[('champ', 0.12747791625908067)]"
"There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.",[]
We had diaper genie with our first it lasted alot longer than this one did before it starts smelling.,[]
"Our child is four months old and it smells up the whole room, after a couple of days after being emptied.",[]
We moved it to the garage.,[]
I find this product easy to operate.,[]
"With any diaper pail you will have odor, but folding the diapers up and using the sticky tabs on the diapers to keep the diaper folded will help keep odor away.",[]
"We bought 2, one for near the crib and one for the main floor.",[]
BRILLIANT idea...didn't have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.,[]
Another helpful idea...put used diaper wipes in the diaper before folding the diaper up...otherwise the wipe will sometimes get caught in the slider and leave poopies on the pail.,[]
How often did we have to empty it?,[]
-  twice/wk when he was 0-3 months...once a wk after that.,[]
We registered for the Diaper Champ when a friend of mine suggested it over the one she owned - the Diaper Genie.,[]
She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.,[]
"Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.",[]
It is mindless to operate.,[]
It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.,[]
"It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).",[]
And it is very easy to clean.,[]
"I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.",[]
I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.,[]
I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in.,[]
I am very pleased with our choice.,[]
This diaper pail is wonderful!,[]
We tried the Saftey-first odor-less one before and this is a thousand times better.,[]
We have never had a problem with this pail smelling bad.,[]
"You can use standard trash bags (unlike the diaper genie), and they are very easy to change.",[]
"Putting diapers in the pail is very easy, our 18month old son loves to help throw his dirty diapers away but it is impossible for him to get them out after they've been thrown.",[]
I am so glad that we decided to spend the money on this pail.,[]
It is definitely worth every penny!,[]
This diaper pail is the best.,[]
"I owned a diaper genie with my first son, and wasnt really happy.",[]
"When it was time for my second son I had hoped there would be improvements to it, however I was wrong.",[]
After it broke I started to look around and found this one.,[]
I figured why not.,[]
"Well its easy ( even my 8 year old like to dispose of the diapers now ) uses regular bags, so if you run out you  dont have to but the special refills, and is oderless!",[]
All in all I say this is a great product that Im glad I tried.,[]
"I recently had had it with my Diaper Genie, so I decided to try the Daiper Champ because there are no expensive bags to buy.",[]
"I can see why some people have written the bad reviews, but done properly there are no problems with this product.",[]
My son is 17 months old and I promise his dirty diapers are very potent and toxic.,[]
I can see why the people have trouble with the older kids daipers stinking up the room.,[]
I put the dirtys into a diaper disposal bag first (takes me all of 20 extra seconds and cost $1 for 100 at the dollar store).,[]
"I admit, I only empty the bag when it is full and I have had ZERO odor, well unti I open it but that is expected!",[]
I have read a couple reviews that said it was a hazard because the bag was exposed to the child.,[]
Those individuals did not follow the instructions properly.,[]
"If done properly, no bag is exposed to the child.",[]
"I will say my son is very tempted to play with the handle from time to time, so I do spray with Lysol when ever I can.",[]
"However, he did that with the Diaper Genie as well.",[]
"Compared to the Daiper Genie, this is a godsend.",[]
"Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!",[]
I believe my Diaper Genie will be in next weeks garage sell even though I want more kids!,[]
"I always read reviews before making a purchase, so I hope a little advice from a very picky mother helped you out.",[]
Thanks!,[]
"Like many others I agree,at first it was great.But once we introduced solids that changed!",[]
!It does not keep all odor from polluting the room it is in.I also found that baby wipes get hung up in the flip-flop top of this product.I actually had to wrestle a rather nasty dried wipe out of the workings of the champ because it got tangled up when I fliped it over to deposit the offending diaper.I didn't know it was tangled untill later on in the day when I tried to put another diaper in and the handle wouldn't budge.So I had to open it and tug on this  dirty thing untill it came out in several yuck little pieces!,[]
!This had happened a few times.So I decided to get a small trash can in which I toss the wipes to avoid another wresteling match.It is an okay product but I think that keeping some plastice grocery bags (in a safe place away from baby of course)near the changing table so you can wrap up the diaper and just place it in the regular trash would work just as well.,"[('wipes', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"However,the fact that it does use regular trash bags is a bonus.No need for special cartriges or bags.",[]
This makes it much easier then some of the other products on the market.Happy shopping!!,[]
!,[]
We got the Champ mainly because it had good reviews and could be used with regular bags.,[]
I hated the thought of having to get to a store with baby products for refills all the time!,[]
"We were really happy with it- easy to use, easy to empty and clean, relatively odorless for the 1st year (except when emptying!).",[]
Now after 16 months of use though the seal has started to come loose and it stinks!,[]
"I came on-line to check out options, and think I'm going to replace it with a new Diaper Champ and try some baking soda after stinky diapers.",[]
A few tips:  Hold the bottom with both feet when opening and after every few diapers jostle it so the diapers don't pile up in the middle.,[]
"Otherwise, for its convenience and effectiveness for a year of heavy use, I think it's a good product.",[]
I decided to register for this diaper pail mainly because of the fact that it didn't require special bags.,[]
My baby is now almost 6 weeks old and we are really happy with it.,[]
You can use regular kitchen garbage bags and our nursery doesn't smell at all.,[]
It's very easy to use.,[]
"I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant.",[]
"It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad.",[]
"Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers.",[]
"Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn't want to spend the money on the refills.",[]
"However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie.",[]
What a difference!!,[]
The only time smell escapes is when we empty it.,[]
"To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.",[]
"If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the &quot;champ&quot;.",[]
"I decided to get the diaper champ after reading reviews on this site, the other parents really helped me out.",[]
"I have a two year old and I also do day care out of my home, my diaper genie stunk, really did.",[]
"I have gone through three of them in a year, and I have called Playtex about it, they didn't seemed concerned, so I tell everyone how much I HATE my diaper genie.",[]
"I changed over thirty diapers a day, give and take a few, so I was so tired of changing the diaper genie refills, the smell was starting to get unbarable also, and oh my, the price really adds up.",[]
That is when I found the Diaper Champ and what a champ it was.,[]
"I thought, huh, no liners needed and I can use my own trash bags, score!",[]
This one was for us.,[]
"And the smell, remember, I change about thirty diapers a day, no smell yet, and I know that there will not be!",[]
"If anyone would like to challenge my thirty diapers a day without a smell to the diaper genie, I will take on that challenge.",[]
This is a wonderful product.,[]
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.,[]
You do not need to bend over like the diaper genie and you are able to do it with one hand!,[]
"My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.",[]
"If you are really considering a diaper pail or you already have one and hate it, this is the thing for you.",[]
"I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.",[]
"When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.",[]
"Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!",[]
If you dont want the baby room to smell bad and do not want to worry buying special bags all time.,[]
This is the product for you.,[]
Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!),[]
- won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.,[]
I've used the Diaper Genie before at my friend's house and hated it.,[]
I'm a mom to triplets and I love this product.,[]
"In fact, we bought 2 (one for upstairs and 1 for downstairs).",[]
It so easy to replace the bag and it doesn't require expensive bags.,[]
I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.,[]
"If you keep a diaper pail full of dirty diapers in the house and think it doesn't smell, you're fooling yourself.",[]
"My review is based on keeping the diaper pail in the garage, which is what we do.I really like this diaper pail!",[]
We had the Safety 1st Easy Saver Diaper Pail and it did nothing to keep the smell out.,[]
We haven't noticed a bad smell coming from this diaper pail yet.,[]
It's great that you don't have to open the top to put a diaper in.,[]
"So, the smell doesn't hit you in the face every time you dispose of a diaper.",[]
My 3 year old loves to take the baby's diapers (wrapped in a plastic bag)and throw them away because this pail is fun to use.,[]
"There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper ""dissapears"".",[]
I highly recommend spending a little extra money and buying this pail!,[]
I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.,[]
"The diaper champ is very easy to use but after a few bad diapers, it has become the Diaper Challenger.We now use sented bags and that helps a bit.",[]
Bottom line:  Empty it often!,[]
"I have a 3 month old baby, and he goes through a lot of diapers!",[]
What I love most about this diaper can is that I don't have to purchase special bags to put in it.,[]
"I considered the diaper genie, but imagine the amount on money spent on buying those special bags for it!",[]
With the Diaper Champ you can use just regular trash bags.,[]
I have also never had a problem with it smelling bad in the room.,[]
It's easy to use.,[]
"However, it is somewhat hard to clean all the pieces.",[]
"I'm sure there is an easier way, but I haven't taken the time to take it apart just yet.",[]
I first purchased a Diaper Genie when my son was born.,[]
It was good but there was the added expense of refills and the time it took to empty it.,[]
Then purchased the Diaper Champ.,[]
I LOVE IT!!!,[]
It takes regular garbage bags that can be purchased in the grocery store (no special trip to the baby store) and it is much quicker to empty.,[]
The only problem I found is that when there is a very smelly diaper in the Diaper Champ you can still smell it.,[]
A deodorizer inside solves the problem.,[]
I wish I had known about the Diaper Champ before I wasted the money on a Diaper Genie!,[]
!,[]
I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch!,[]
It's so easy to use.,[]
I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months.,[]
"Once she started eating more ""real"" foods, her diapers became much smellier.",[]
She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ.,[]
"We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!",[]
I love this diaper pale and wouldn't dream of trying anything else.,[]
It is great that you can use regular trashbags and not have to buy expensive cartridges.,[]
So far it has done great on containing the odor and I like how easy it is to use.,[]
Worth every single penny and then some!,[]
"I orginally registered for the famous ""Diaper Genie"" but was so thankful that my mother-in-law purchased this one instead after doing some research of her own.",[]
No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!,[]
I am even thinking of purchasing one for my upstairs as well.,[]
Definitely the best one on the market.,[]
I purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the Diaper Genie.,[]
"The Diaper Champ was hands down the best diaper pail I used while my child was in diapers (I used three: Diaper Genie, Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and the Diaper Champ).",[]
"I didn't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore, it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and it's really easy to use - drop a diaper in, flip the handle over, done!",[]
I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing.,[]
"I passed this diaper pail on to a friend once I was finished with it, and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future.",[]
"The Diaper Champ has performed beautifully so far for us - my daughter is 14 weeks old, and we have been very pleased with the ease of use and lack of odor.",[]
"Especially nice is the fact that no special refills are needed, which not only saves money but is more convenient.",[]
"We just use the same drawstring trash bags that we use in our kitchen, which can be bought in bulk quantities.",[]
I got this for my daughter and I just think it's great.,[]
We have this in her room and I haven't smelled any ordors coming from it except for when you open it up to take out the bag.,[]
I also love the fact that you can use just regular bags.,[]
I know of someone that had a diaper genie and she still had a diaper in it from when her baby was born and she was about 2 months at that time.,[]
I've found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there.,[]
"I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.",[]
I would highly recommend this to anyone.,[]
I loved the Diaper Champ.,[]
It was very easy to use and didnt require special bags!,[]
"Nice, plain, simple and IT WORKS.",[]
I would strongly suggest this over other products.,[]
I have heard SO many horror storys about other diaper pails that are out there.,[]
"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.",[]
"I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.",[]
I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in.,[]
Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away.,[]
It can also be hard to open-I've broken several nails on it.,[]
"I've only had it a few weeks (I've been using it for my toddler's diapers until my new baby comes), and I'm hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting.",[]
"Otherwise, it's great that it holds more diapers, and it's SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.",[]
I don't need two hands for it!,[]
I have tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie and I far and away prefer this product.,[]
"It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)",[]
"and you don't have to buy special cartridges to use with it, just a regular old plastic trash can liner is all it takes.",[]
It's also quite tall so several days can go by before emptying.,[]
"Love it, love it, love it!",[]
Please ignore any of the bad reviews!,[]
This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.,[]
"If you don't change the diaper pail every few days, it's going to stink.",[]
No matter what the brand is.,[]
"Anyway, the thing I love most about this product is the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.",[]
Our garbage bag of choice is Forceflex.,[]
They are extremely strong and don't tear easily.,[]
It is also very easy to switch the bags.,[]
I just wanted to let everyone know that it's easy to use (much easier than the diaper genie)and very convenient.-Jay's Mommy,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
I first got it when my my son was born (he's now 2 1/2) and now I use it for my daughter (5 months) and my son.,[]
It holds the diaper smell in very well.,[]
I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.,[]
I wouldn't recommend leaving diapers in for extended periods of time but that's just common sense.,[]
My favorite thing is I can use standard garbage bags and do not have to buy special bags.,[]
I've recommended this pail to all new mother's I know.,[]
Definitly a great buy!,[]
!,[]
We are cloth diaper users and were attracked to the diaper champ because it said it could be used for cloth diapers and it keeps the smell in unlike other diaper pails.,[]
We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.,[]
Some of our diaper covers also got stuck in the mechanism and I had to take it apart with a screwdriver to avoid ripping the cover.,[]
Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.,[]
"If you are planning to use cloth, this is not the pail for you.If your are using disposables, I think this pail would be great since you can wad them up into a tight ball.",[]
It doesn't stink except when you open it to change the liner and it takes regular bags.,[]
"This is such a great diaper pail, a thousand times better than the Diaper Genie (which I hated - you had to constantly buy the refill bags and it was not as odor free as they claimed)This diaper pail is great because you can use any kind of trash or plastic bags (I find that tall kitchen trash bags work the best) and it really is odor free.",[]
There's nothing worse than the smell of dirty diapers!!,[]
This diaper pail has solved that problem for me!,[]
And it's inexpensive!,[]
I highly recommend!,[]
I used this in the nursery for the 1st 5-6 months then moved it to the garage.,[]
"In the nursery, I could leave it about 3 or 4 days before it started smelling.",[]
It held about 14 or 15 infant diapers at a time.,[]
I have been using my champ for 2 1/2 years now and I still LOVE IT.,[]
After my son turned a year old I did start to notice that his stinky diapers were getting stinkier and the odor was starting to leak out.,[]
We'd clean it or spray Lysol but now we have found the solution.,[]
GLAD has come out with odor protection trash bags.,[]
Use one of these instead of a regular trash bag and you will never smell anything foul coming from the Champ again.,[]
"After reading the reviews and comparing with the diaper genie, I went with the diaper champ; mainly because it didn't require expensive refills.",[]
I love that i can use my own trash bags!,[]
I change the bags about 2 times/week and have not noticed any smells.,[]
"I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).",[]
"Overall, highly recommend it!",[]
Great product!,[]
You only need to use one hand so it's easy to do while holding squirming baby.,[]
Never had a bad smell come out of it!!!!,[]
I would give it 10 stars if I could!,[]
I have used this item for 22 months and love it!,[]
I agree with another reviewer that you do not want to remove any foam piece that may come come out!,[]
I made the same error!,[]
I had gotten a diaper tab stuck and it pulled a small pice of this foam out.,[]
I then dug the rest out thinking it was a clog of paper.,[]
It still works quite well but was better before my error.,[]
I change it once a week.,[]
Since she is almost 2 now I do find that on the 5th day or so it is gettinf full and smells a little-so sometimes I empty it sooner.,[]
It is much better than other pails that my friends have!,[]
I love the easy drop in chute- it works great!,[]
This is a winner for me!,[]
I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
I fought with the Diaper Geanie throughout my first son.,[]
"This is so much easier to use, the three year old has mastered it!",[]
Uses your own bags.,[]
Don't waste time with others.,[]
This is the best diaper pail.,[]
Ive had it for a month now and have not had so much as a smell of dirty diapers in the nursery.,[]
We fill it up fast as we have twins.,[]
"I think its great we dont have to buy expensive refills, just use our own bags.",[]
I HAVE A 3 MONTH OLD SON AND I OWN THE DIAPER CHAMP.,[]
THE ODOR CONTROL IS NON EXSISTANT----MY SONS ROOM STINKS.,[]
"NOT ONLY THAT BUT WHEN I CHANGE THE PAIL I HAVE LITTLE BUGS IN THE BAG AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAIL, AND I CHANGE THE BAG 3 OR 4 TIMES A WEEK.",[]
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.,[]
SAVE YOUR MONEY,[]
"I received the Champ at my baby shower, and continue to thank my sister for it.",[]
"My son can really drop a load, and you would almost never know it once it is in the pail.",[]
"We do basic maintenance, like cleaning it every so often and spraying Lysol to keep it fresh.",[]
We save SOOO much money buying 150 ct 13 gal garbage bags for about $5.,[]
"My one suggestion would be to change the bags out more ofen then needed, though.",[]
"It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.",[]
I highly recommend owning one.,[]
Good Luck!,[]
I chose this over the Diaper Genie because it sounded much more user friendly...I liked the fact that I could use regular kitchen trash bags in it.,[]
"Unfortunately, because of the space taken up by the lid, you don't fill up the trash bag (it only uses about half the bag), and even with the scented trash bags, it still smells.",[]
"It was fine for the first few months when my son was breastfed, but as soon as the real stools started coming along, the smell in his room became unbearable.",[]
"We relegated the Diaper Champ to the garage, then ultimately (out of convenience), started disposing of the diapers directly into our big trash bins outside.",[]
"It's a pain going outside with every poopy diaper, but my neighbor (whose daughter is one month younger than my son) went through the exact same thing with the Diaper Genie.",[]
Guess it's just one of the perks of mommy-hood!!!,[]
"Also, whenever I went to change out the bag, I would almost ALWAYS break a nail (which weren't long to begin with!).",[]
"We have a new baby on the way now, and I'm just getting a flip-top white trash bin for her room, since I know it will only be in there for a few months anyway...",[]
I absolutely love the diaper champ.,[]
It is very easy to use and keeps the room from smelling.,[]
It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.,[]
I would definetly recommend this product.,[]
The diaper champ worked pretty well until maybe our son was about 12 months or so.,[]
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.,[]
"His room always smells like a poopy diaper that was just changed, even after it's been cleaned and you've just added one diaper to it.",[]
"I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.",[]
I find the Diaper Champ to be the easiest way to deal with those nasty diapers.,[]
Advantages over the competition - MUCH easier to use (especially one handed while holding baby with the other) and uses regular tall kitchen can bags (no special bags to buy).,[]
"When baby gets a little older and soiled diapers can be smelly, just use small plastic grocery bags to contain those.",[]
Wet diapers are fine.,[]
"Over all, we liked this product.",[]
"At least for us, it most contains the smell, and is easy to use.",[]
"However, the design is flawed in that diapers easily get stuck in the top, leading to problems changing the bag.",[]
"However, it is still better than nothing.",[]
This is an excellent idea having the lid to dispose of diapers.There is no odor and extremely easy to use.,[]
Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!,[]
We got this after our Diaper Genie broke.,[]
We picked this one because we thought it would be easier to use the regular trash bags.,[]
We used it for a few months and then threw it away.,[]
Totally inferior to the Diaper Genie.,[]
"You may not smell the diapers when they're IN the Diaper Champ, but there's no getting away from the smell when you have to empty it.",[]
We're having another baby and will definitely buy the Diaper Genie.,[]
I love this product.,[]
"It is easy to assemble, easy to use, easy to change the bag, and keeps all odors out of our precious baby's room!",[]
I agree with most everybody.,[]
It is much cheaper to use this product than ones that take cartridges BUT I don't think that it helps with the odor as much as ones like Diaper Genie.,[]
The main reason we bought The Champ was that with the diaper Genie you had to shuve the diaper into the pocket area then twist and with a digestive system like my sons there ends up being more on you than in the diaper.,[]
This is the best and easiest pail to use.,[]
It only requires one hand.,[]
I love that it uses any type of garbage bag.,[]
I only notice a smell when I change the bag or when my daughter has really foul BM.,[]
But I do not think even the diaper genie can block that smell.,[]
It is the best thing I got for the nursery.,[]
I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.,[]
This is something I would definetly recommend.,[]
"After hearing all of my friends complain about their Diaper Genies, I decided to do a little research of my own.",[]
"And after using the Fisher-Price ""Odorless"" (yeah right!)",[]
"pail, I decided to put the Diaper Champ to the test.",[]
"Boy, was I glad I did!",[]
"I have used the Diaper Champ since February 7th, and I absolutley love it!No smell what-so-ever and one-handed operation make this product a definite must-have!",[]
"Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!",[]
"The best part, in my opinion, is that you don't need anything more than the average 13 gallon trash bag... unlike the Diaper Genie system.I would definitely recommend this diaper system to every mom out there!",[]
This is the Champ of diaper pails.,[]
"No costly refills, works great with even the cheapest diapers.",[]
Perfect!,[]
We have 4 kidos and 3 are in diapers (we had twins the last time).,[]
With the previous 2 we tried the genie- alot of trouble and expensive for refills and didnt elminate the odor and the fisher price- no refills to buy but DOES NOT eliminate any odor--just like a trash bucket.,[]
So decided to try this one and it is the best!,[]
It eliminates almost all the odor and it has no refills and is hold ALOT!,[]
"First of all, I don't know of a single diaper pail will keep the odor of a poopy diaper contained.",[]
Those go right in the garbage outside!,[]
"This diaper pail is economical, you can buy bulk garbage bags or even scented ones to line the pail with for much less than you can find the refills for the Genie.",[]
It is so easy to operate and emptying it is much easier than the Diaper Genie.,[]
"Since I don't put poopy diapers in it, I can usually go a whole week before I have to empty it.",[]
Don't get caught up in the trendy Diaper Genie.,[]
This is a much better unit.,[]
What a great diaper pail!,[]
Easy one hand operation allows you to keep one hand on your baby if kept next to your changing table.,[]
"NO EXPENSIVE REFILLS NEEDED, I use ordinary kitchen bags, which eliminates having to run to a specialty store to find special refill bags.As another mom wrote, it is a good idea to wrap soiled diapers as small & tight as you can to avoid them from getting stuck in the cylinder and it will also allow you to fit more in the pail.CAUTION, be careful releasing the unlock handle, I pinched my fingers the first time I opened it, but then started using a baby washcloth as a cushion for my fingertips and haven't had any more mishaps.","[('cushion', 0.06815242300922286)]"
Small price to pay for an odorless seal.,[]
I have 7 month old twins and the Diaper Champ has been a &quot;champ&quot; for us!!,[]
Do you know how many diapers that twins go through?,[]
A LOT!,[]
We decided to use this system because we would not have to buy any costly refills.,[]
We have not been disappointed in this system.,[]
It works great and cleans up very easily.,[]
I would recommend this diaper disposal system to all parents!,[]
It is so easy to use.,[]
You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag.,[]
I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.,[]
"We owned a diaper genie for our daughter, who's now almost 3.It was the ""new and improved"" version, and if it was improved, the older model may as well been a plastic bag!",[]
"It was difficult to use, costly, wasted bags, and SMELLED... With the twins, we knew we would change systems.The Champ was the option we were hoping would work, no refills to waste your money on, and it would hopefully contain smells better.DISPOSING A DIAPER*  You change baby, and than wrap the diaper up with the tape attached, so it doesn't get caught on anything (we also place the dirty wipes into the ""diaper ball"")*  Open the champ and place the diaper in correctly.","[('diaper', 0.07972329735209974)]"
"We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.",[]
"*  Than you close it, and the diaper should ""plop"" into the base, and its disposed of!The Genie was much more difficult.",[]
"You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.","[('bag', 0.08115869927556835)]"
"*  We like to place a deodorizer in the bottom as well*  Place your bag inside (we like to use lilac scented bags, cheap store bought brand) and place the top back on.Again this is MUCH easier than the slicing, tying, and bagging needed with a diaper genie, and a much faster process.","[('place', 0.13813879768802256)]"
"******We found with the really stinky diapers, that its best to dispose of them outside, or roll them into their own bag (used grocery bags are fine) and maybe spray some Lysol into the bin every disposal or so.",[]
"IF THE PAIL BEGINS TO SMELL, CHANGE THE BAG AND WASH IT OUT!",[]
"Also when diapers begin to get jammed, just change the bag and your problem will be solved!",[]
"******So far (and yes, the boys DID start solids) the Champ contains the smell.",[]
We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.,[]
"Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best ""diaper solution"" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)",[]
"but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.",[]
"I can guarantee if you just want to plop diapers in, and change the bag without any work, you will be disappointed... Its better than garbage pails, and much safer (too hard for kids to get diapers out).",[]
"We love the Champ, and will defiantly be keeping it around!",[]
"this is so easy to use even my 3year old can use it, not like other diaper pails.",[]
it saves us money by being able to use the garbage bags we already have and use for the kitchen and its odor free :),[]
"We debated on which pail to register for, but like most people, my husband didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.",[]
That settled it for us and we got the diaper champ.,[]
"It does do a pretty good job by itself containing odors, but we do take some extra steps to make sure it doesn't smell up my baby's room.1) For poopy diapers we use the inexpensive ""diaper disposal bags"" which are usually lightly scented and can make the diaper drop a little less messy.2) When we change the bag once a week or so, I wipe it out with an antibacterial wipe and then spray it with lysol or other type disinfectant spray.Then just let it air out a little and put in a new bag.This has worked like a charm so far!","[('odors', 0.08277485376027528)]"
"We've used our Diaper Champ for almost three years now, with good success.",[]
"I love that it uses basic cheap kitchen trash bags, and that it is so user-friendly (Diaper Genie at the pediatrician's office is too difficult to figure out).",[]
"We keep odors under control two ways: first, we dump the poop into the potty, which is now an integral part of our potty training regimen; second, every time we take out the bag, which is twice a week, I spray the insides with Lysol and then leave the lid open over night.","[('ways', 0.10549480957565062)]"
No smelly odors!,[]
"Just for kicks, I've washed it out with Clorox in the bathtub once or twice, but I don't really know if that was necessary or not.",[]
My mother got this for me from my baby registry on Amazon.,[]
I like the fact that it doesn't take special bags.,[]
It does maintain odor very well.,[]
The only thing I have noticed is that the plunger gets stuck on one side.,[]
This may just be a manufacture defect on mine.,[]
"All in all, very worth it.",[]
I am writing as I was unsure to buy either the diaper genie or champ.,[]
"After reading reviews I went with the champ and love it, so far no problems.",[]
"Our son is just about 2 months now, the champ is in his room, I line it with a scented 8 gal bag and have never detected any odors!!",[]
!,[]
"it's so easy to use, and keeps the odor away.",[]
Uses regular trash bags which is a great plus.,[]
easy to clean and assemble.,[]
Great shower gift.,[]
"We bought this, tried it and never got it to work properly.",[]
The air-lock gasket kept getting caught when you would try to drop the diaper into the hopper.,[]
"Being an engineer, I quickly concluded it was pointless to expend any energy on getting it to work, and just threw it out.",[]
"We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.",[]
"If you get a SimpleHuman can, I recommend getting the bags designed to be used with the can.",[]
Great investment.,[]
Easy to use!,[]
"It doesn't hold as many diapers as our last diaper pail, but it doesn't smell anywhere as bad.",[]
I am planning on using it as a bathroom garbage after my son is out of diapers.,[]
Both of my sister-in-laws own this and they both recommended it to me.,[]
It uses regular 13 gallon garbage bags which is very convenient.,[]
It's well worth the money!,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
"Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out.",[]
"The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys.",[]
I can't believe how many people gave this item a negative review.,[]
It gets full too fast.,[]
"- Change it when it gets full, and stop being lazy!",[]
The diapers get stuck.,[]
#NAME?,[]
"If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.",[]
"Or, you could take a whole 10 seconds to wrap the diaper in upon itself, and use the sticky parts to keep it together.",[]
Problem solved.,[]
The smell leaks out.,[]
"- 10% rule, folks...",[]
Put the bags in properly.,[]
"I've used this thing for 4 weeks now, and the only time it smells is when the bag is getting changed, which is expected.",[]
"In fact, the first time I opened the champ, I was assaulted by the smell of dirty diapers, and I was astounded that the champ had kept all that smell in.",[]
Wipes get stuck when you put them in it.,[]
#NAME?,[]
"Or how's this...  don't put the wipes in it by themselves.This item is a MUST HAVE for any nursery, or wherever you change your babies diapers, hands down.",[]
We were former diaper genie fans until after about 8 mos of usage it was nearly impossible to change out the refill containers.,[]
"It seemed that the ring on the inside had worn down, and the refill wouldn't fit.",[]
We became frustrated and went immediately to the store and purchased this diaper champ.,[]
I so wished I had read the reviews on this product prior to my purchase.,[]
I loved the fact that you could drop the diaper in the small opening and it immediately vanished to the inside of the pail.,[]
"However, the smells remained, causing our son's room to reek of waste.",[]
"No matter how many times we changed the bags, the smell never went away.",[]
"Nice concept, but a total waste of money.",[]
We ended up going back and buying another diaper genie.,[]
The one star I gave it is for the neat way you drop the diapers into the pail.,[]
"I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.",[]
At first use this product seems like it should be great but a little more use and thought proves otherwise.,[]
"When the bag gets full, it overflows.",[]
You won't know it's full until it overflows.,[]
Once it overflows it's disgusting.,[]
You will have to take all the dirty diapers and try to push them into the bag by hand.,[]
"Also, the way the bag is inserted, 3 sides are held down to keep it from collapsing but the 4th side has no such restraint and will inevitably have the edge touching the dirty diapers.That leads to the final flaw.",[]
When it's time to take the bag out (whether it overflowed or not) the thing is wide open.,[]
"Anything there is to smell or touch, you will smell or touch it.",[]
This diaper pail is great.,[]
It is the third one that I have tried.,[]
I just wish that I had it 4 years ago with my first child.,[]
It is very easy to use.,[]
You don't need special liners or refills.,[]
A regular garbage bag works fine.,[]
I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out.,[]
"The Diaper Champ doesn't totally keep odors away, but it works just as well if not better than the others I have tried.",[]
The diaper champ is very easy to use.,[]
"You only need one hand to ""operate"" it.",[]
"My 2 year old loves ""helping"" out and can independently use it.",[]
"This is a great diaper disposal system, but from reading many of the negative reviews I think there are many individuals who did not bother to read the instructions.",[]
"the bag goes through the hole in the blue retaining ring,  then gets folded over the retaing ring and locked in place, at no point should any of the bag be out side the pale and if the bag is put in place like a regular trash can it will not seal properly and you will probaly get a smell.","[('bag', 0.18818321310398275)]"
I can not comment on the few reviews who had a seal falure for I have not had mine long enough.,[]
Ok - so we were so convinced when we saw this product that we asked for 2 as a baby gift and added them to our registry.,[]
The unfortunate thing is that we have many kind friends and we received them both as a shower gift.We were excited and placed one upstairs and one downstairs.,[]
They worked fine and we continued to change the bags 2-3 times per week.,[]
BUT our baby like many others grew up.,[]
"Once he was on formula and jar foods, we started to notice this foul odor.",[]
"We cleaned out the Diaper Champ regularly, but even the smell of ammonia from his urine was too powerful.",[]
"We were using 13 gallon trash bags inside, spraying with lysol with every diaper, etc.",[]
"The smell was just so unbearable.We contacted Toys R Us, who gave us the phone number for Baby Trend in Canada.",[]
We tried calling and left messages that were never returned.,[]
Finally we sent an email.,[]
Their customer service (if you can call it that) told us that nobody had EVER complained about this product.,[]
We asked for a supervisor to call us.,[]
"After one month, we did not hear anything, so we sent a follow-up email to the customer service rep asking for a status on when the supervisor might get back to us.",[]
"The reply we received was, ""I report to my supervisor and only my supervisor.",[]
"I do not know when or if they will contact you"".",[]
"So much for a company that backs its products.To date, it has been several months and we have not heard from anyone at Baby Trend - even their customer service seems to have failed, like a leaky diaper!",[]
I thought this would be great because you could use your own trash bags.,[]
"However, we have oder control bags and my one year olds room still stinks.",[]
We spray it with lysol daily and this diaper trash can just doesn't control oders.,[]
I really didn't like it from the start because if you put anything but a folded up diaper in it then it jams.,[]
I often want to throw a lone wipe in but it gets caught.,[]
I am going to buy the Diaper Gene 2 today.,[]
Hopefully it is better.,[]
"Easy to use, easy to clean, cheaper to use, not bad-looking either.",[]
Any plastic shopping bag will work in this diaper pail.,[]
The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it.,[]
But it will certainly be an even greater challenge for your child to open!,[]
I spent a lot of time choosing a diaper disposal system because I wanted to get the easiest and least smelly option!,[]
"I had recommendations for the Genie, but then I saw the Champ at my sister-in-law's house - wow, it looked so easy!",[]
No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?),[]
"I cannot recommend this enough - cheaper than the Dekor, one handed action, it uses regular trash bags (I suggest the scented ones)...",[]
I change the bag every few days and spray the inside with Lysol every few changes.,[]
"I've been using this for 10 months and I have never had an odor problem, even though the odor ring thing did become loose...",[]
"When it comes to diaper systems, the Champ wins hands-down!",[]
!,[]
"[...]  Even if your nails are not very long, you will inevitably break off whatever you do have opening the top of this diaper pail.",[]
"And no matter how often you change the bag, it will always smell like poop.",[]
"I cleaned and disinfected mine to death, even soaking it in Lysol cleaner for days and there is no way to get that smell out.",[]
It's really gross.,[]
You're better off using it just for wet diapers and putting smelly diapers in a small plastic grocery bag and taking them right out to the garbage cans in the garage until garbage day.,[]
"I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.",[]
"The Diaper Genie may be a pain because you have to purchase refills, but it is much better controlling the smell.",[]
I read many reviews about diaper disposals and decided on the Diaper Champ and am VERY glad I did!,[]
I had only heard about diaper genie but had never used it until I was visiting my brother who had one.,[]
"Now that I have used both, I am even more certain that I like the diaper champ!",[]
"With the diaper genie, you have to push the dirty diaper low enough so you can then twist the lid (the whole diaper sausage thing).",[]
I didn't know that until I used it.,[]
YUCK!,[]
Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.,[]
The diaper champ is much easier...put the diaper in the lid and then flip the lid from one side to the other.,[]
"Being able to use regular trash bags is what hooked me in but now that I have used it, I'm sold!",[]
There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.,[]
"Just keep a stick-up in the diaper champ, and you'll be fine!",[]
Let's face it.,[]
This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.,[]
One cannot expect that it will be odor free.,[]
Mine certainly isn't.,[]
"It is my fault, though.",[]
"If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.",[]
"But alas, I am lazy.",[]
"So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.",[]
Works for me.,[]
"I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.",[]
But that was my own fault.,[]
I did not have it on the floor.,[]
"When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.",[]
What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.,[]
"Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.",[]
"It's also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don't have to bend over so much to flip the lid.",[]
I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.,[]
This diaper champ is good because it doesn't require the use of particular liners -- regular kitchen trash bags work great.,[]
And I really can't complain about the smell.,[]
"If it starts to smell, it's our laziness for not emptying it when we should have.",[]
I have twin boys so I have one upstairs in their bedroom and one near our make-shift changing table in the den.Would I buy one for someone expecting a baby?,[]
NO.,[]
"Diapers get stuck and jammed and the two side ""knobs"" fall off.We still use it because I'm not going out to buy another.",[]
But it's not a contraption I'd recommend.,[]
"I have no advice as to which ones are better, as I've only used this one.",[]
I liked the ease of using our own trash bags and not having the expense or inconvenience of purchasing particular liners.,[]
"I have been through the Diaper Genie, the Safety 1st diaper pail, and this one.",[]
I've liked this one the least.,[]
The diaper genie worked the longest for keeping odors away -about 9-10 months.,[]
(I washed it with bleach once and it was never the same after that).,[]
But it was annoying to have to buy the refill bags.,[]
So we bought the Safety 1st pail next.,[]
That lasted about 4-5 months and the spring broke.,[]
I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.,[]
"One good dirty diaper and the room smells, even if you flip the handle twice.",[]
I've tried putting baking soda on the bottom and have tried the odor eating garbage bags and neither idea has helped with the odors.,[]
I also found that this one is the hardest to clean (especially the cylinder).My daughter also likes to flip the handle-and if that cylinder is not sitting right...the stench is awful.,[]
Truthfully I have found that none of these systems work 100%.,[]
I'm about ready to use my kitchen pail (at least the garbage is thrown out every day).,[]
I agree with many that this is a great product.,[]
"Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.",[]
"We still use it for urine only diapers, and it is great.I have heard that the diaper genie does a better job with keeping the toddler diapers contained.",[]
But at what cost?,[]
In our house we just take the bm diapers straight to the outside trash.,[]
We keep a large paper bag from the grocery store to contain them in our larger trash can.,[]
"(Per our garbage man's request, he was having to get them out by hand before then because they would get stuck.)",[]
While this diaper pail work alright it has some flaws.,[]
1st of all I was given a diper gennie as a hand me down from a friend whose son is now almost 10 years old.,[]
I was at first able to buy the expensive inserts (that last a long time by the way) and this pail worked well.,[]
It kept the smell out and it served its function.,[]
"I was disappointed to find that they soon replace this pail with the new and improved diaper gennie, and I became very frustrated to find the new inserts did not fit the old pail and the company stoped making the old inserts.",[]
Well I thought a diaper pail is a diaper pail.,[]
Right!,[]
"No, first I bought a cheap version of the diaper champ Which did nothing at all to keep the smell down.",[]
Then I decided (after reading some of the reviews) to try the diaper champ.,[]
At 1st it worked well but after the first week or so the smell started to come back.,[]
I say the it works fair.,[]
"It's higher maintenance than the Gennie, and I fear I have wasted time and money.",[]
I should have just given in and bought the New improved thing in the first place.,[]
Sorry diaper champ.,[]
I think what the pail is missing is some type of seal that should close when you turn the upper part of the pail.,[]
Oh 1 more thing.,[]
My 1 year old is curious about it and trys to play with the upper part that turns.,[]
The Gennie is designed to just close and seal.,[]
Another draw back for me with the Champ.,[]
So if you have the time to clean this pail once a week and want to save a little money then I say go for it.,[]
But I'm wishing I'd just went out for a little extra money at the time for the other pail.,[]
The Diamper Champ has not gone over well in our houselhold.,[]
Just after a few diaper changes my son's entire nursery reaks of dirty diaper.,[]
We've even resorted to tying the poopy diapers up in a grocery bag first and the room STILL smells.,[]
Guess we are moving on to something else.....,[]
We received a Diaper Champ as a baby shower gift when our daughter was born in March of 2004.,[]
"We have been using it ever since, through her entire time in diapers and now we use it for our 1 year old son.",[]
It is simply fabulous.,[]
"Extremely simple to operate, uses any bag, and we have had no stink trouble even with all that use (about 10,000 diapers and counting!).",[]
We were even able to keep using it when we switched our son to cloth diapers a few months back.,[]
I just use a nylon bag instead of a trash bag and it's a piece of cake.,[]
The Diaper Champ is one of my all-time favorite baby products.,[]
I bought the Champ diaper pail because you can use any bags.,[]
What a mistake!,[]
I should have done my research.,[]
The smell that lingers in the room is unbearable.,[]
I finally bought the Neat Diaper Disposal it might require cassettes but at lease there is nor more stinky smell in my son's room.,[]
"We were totally dissatisfied with the results from our Diaper Champ...we had a problem with odor escaping right from the start...and our daughter was breast fed exclusively for 10 months, so it had nothing to do with a change in her diet.",[]
Over time we noticed that the foam pieces of the pail do become increasingly stinky and are very difficult to clean...even bleach couldn't get the smell out!,[]
My sister-in-law had the Diaper Genie for her daughter years before I had my son.,[]
I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.,[]
"You have to use 2 hands to open the top and then push the icky diaper past the opening, risking touching the contents.",[]
"In light of all that, I had decided to go with a plain old diaper pail.",[]
I didn't figure it could be much worse and was certainly cheaper at [$$$].,[]
"Now that my son is a year old and eating table food, it has become downright unbearable.",[]
I didn't know there was an alternative to the Genie until I came here.,[]
This week I bought the Diaper Champ as recommended.,[]
I am so glad I did.,[]
"It was about [$$$] more than the Genie, but definitely worth it...",[]
"Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!",[]
"I can dump the diaper and still have a hand free to keep him from rolling off the table.My only suggestion is that you tape the diaper up to get it into the slot easily, but I have always done that anyway.",[]
Now I know if I smell poop it's my son and not the diaper pail!,[]
I had the diaper genie with my 4 year old and I wasn't too impressed with it.,[]
I now have a 10 day old baby and I have a diaper champ.,[]
It is so easy to use and I just use my regular trash bags in it.,[]
"Now, my 4 year old loves to be in charge of throwing out the diapers for me.",[]
It is that simple.,[]
"Plus, there is no odor, even when it is full!",[]
I would reccomend this to anyone!,[]
!,[]
"We are using fitted cloth diapers and now that my daughter is 6 months old and we are using a larger size diaper, the snaps are always getting caught on the way into the pail.",[]
Very frustrating and messy.,[]
The pail also doesn't hold very many diapers and I find my self washing diapers more often that I would normally have to.,[]
"Contrary to other postings, I have not had any problems with odor.",[]
"I will eventually have to get a new pail, but I hate the thought of dumping a huge hunk of hardly used plastic in a landfill.",[]
When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.,[]
Now I would recommend it to everyone.,[]
My day care provider even uses one.,[]
I don't have a problem with odor.,[]
I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.,[]
"Also, if the diaper is a little fuller than usual I wrap it in a bag before disposing of it...a tip from my daycare provider.",[]
Overall I have been very pleased.,[]
We had a friend who received this product as a gift and loved it.,[]
She insisted that this was the diaper pail to have.,[]
We bought it and agree 100%.,[]
It is very easy to use and it controls odors.,[]
We love the fact that you can use any garbage bag (saves a ton of money over the Diaper Genie) and we only have to empty it once every 5-6 days.,[]
We now buy this for every baby shower gift that we go to and tell everyone not to get the Genie because this is the best diaper pail around.,[]
I really loved the ease of using the Diaper Champ - unfortunately when I my son started eating solid foods - the Diaper Champ just didn't keep the smells from invading my whole house - Yuck!,[]
Nice try Diaper Champ - sorry I had to sell mine in a yard sale when my son was 10 months old and go buy a Diaper Genie - a product not without flaws itself - but at least it keeps the smells to itself.,[]
i love this diaper champ..not only does it save money on bags cause you use whatever brand you want it is bigger so it holds more and i havent had a smell come out of it!,[]
My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!,[]
"Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in.",[]
Wonderful item!!,[]
(as you can tell i have use the diaper genie with my first child)  totally recommend the diaper champ!!,[]
!,[]
"This item is great, you can you any bags you want (unlike the diaper Genie)!!!!!",[]
It is great for the price!!,[]
!,[]
All I have to say is I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!,[]
This product is far better than the diaper genie or any other similar product on the market!!!!,[]
"As for the reviews regarding the odor, if you buy the scented garbage bags and change the diaper champ on a regular basis (i.e.",[]
at least once a week)  there is no odor!!!,[]
I love it and I highly recommend it.,[]
Plus alot of money is saved by using regular garbage bags!!,[]
I am so glad I bought this one.,[]
"It is easy, economical and its looks nice.",[]
"A lot of perople complain about their pails smelling, well obviously it is going to end up smelling eventually.",[]
Look at what it is holding!!,[]
!But so far this has been great.,[]
Someone bought me a diaper genie for my shower with 4 refill cartridges becauseI complained about how expensive it would eventually become.,[]
"I didn't care, I still took them all back and exchaged them for a champ.",[]
"I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).",[]
"The Diaper champ is easy, clean (don't have to touch the diaper) and you can do it one handed which is a must with a fussy or sleepy baby.",[]
(and a baby who is rolling over already).,[]
Even my cousin who has two children says she enjoys this one mush better than the diaper genie she used with the first one.,[]
Antoher of my cousins had the diapre genie and absolutely hated it.,[]
"She lived in an apartment complex and just ended up sticking it outside, because it stunk an dit was ridiculously hard to change.I do have one complaint with the diaper champ, the first time I tried to open it, I broke my nails because of latch that keeps it closed.",[]
Now I have learned to open it slowly.,[]
but that is it.Don't get caught up in a stupid trend.,[]
It really isnt worth it.,[]
I gave away my genie and bought one of these.,[]
This is so much easier and smells less.,[]
"Yes, it does give odors but come on your dealing with poop.",[]
A friend suggested a car freshner of baby powder..,[]
I haven't tried it yet but the odor is so much better than those stinky bags that you have to buy for the genie.,[]
The odor doesn't bother me... this is an easy CHEAPER product.. using regular bags is so much easier.. my husband loves the two way swivle.. so you don't have to use so much of your attention away from your child...,[]
The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!,[]
"After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down.",[]
"It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!",[]
"!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol?",[]
?,[]
If you can love a diaper pail that is...,[]
The Diaper Champ is EASY to use (one hand) and very sturdy.,[]
No parts to break unlike the other leading brand.,[]
"It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.",[]
Here's a tip:  Tie dirty diapers in grocery sacks before depositing into the Diaper Champ.,[]
NO SMELL WHATSOEVER that way!,[]
For my first born I purchased the Diaper Genie.,[]
It worked out well for the first 6 months.,[]
As the diaper sizes got larger the harder it was to get the diaper to fit.,[]
"It would squish out the sides, making a horrible mess!",[]
So I purchased the wide mouth size.,[]
More $$!,[]
"The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.",[]
"SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby's room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!","[('garbage', 0.05792611951136501)]"
It was with great pleasure that we threw this USELESS item in the trasth.,[]
"We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!",[]
Do not buy unless you plan on changing the pail as much as your child.,[]
This is a great product.,[]
Buy one for anywhere you have a changing station for the baby.,[]
"We have one for upstairs and down, and there is never a smell.",[]
It's easy to use.,[]
"It's a little hard to put a garbage bag in,but no big deal.",[]
I do admit I like the idea of using regular trash bags but the oder that it leaves is horrible.,[]
I couldn't stand the smell any longer and got rid of the Diaper Champ!,[]
It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.,[]
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NEWBORNS DO NOT HAVE SMELLY DIAPERS!,[]
So of course you will not smell anything until your little one starts to eat more solid foods.,[]
It is just disgusting!,[]
I highly recommend saving yourself $30 and taking the trash out once a day.,[]
"I think that parents of infants are probably pleased with this pail, but taking care of two toddlers I had some real concerns when I had this diaper pail.1.",[]
I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.,[]
"If you have only a wipe or something smaller to throw away they tend to make the ""plunger"" stick.",[]
Also not good with pull-up diapers since you can not secure them with the velcro tabs.3.,[]
"We had a babysitter put a really messy diaper in the pail without wrapping it up and the ""plunger"" area was IMPOSSIBLE to clean and held water in it when I tried to spray it out.",[]
I ended up having to throw it out.4.,[]
Only OK keeping out the smells.,[]
When you put a diaper down a whoosh of nasty smelling air comes out.I ended up getting the new diaper genie to replace this one and love it in comparison mostly for cleanliness issues.,[]
This is my third try getting a diaper pail (at first I was adament about not getting special refills) and I finally got it right.,[]
I LOVE this item!,[]
It is one of the most useful of the gifts I received at my shower.,[]
"My baby is 10 weeks old and we have used it since the first day - came highly recommended by my Sister in Law, who has a 22 month old and she still uses hers!",[]
"I think some of the bad reviews are misleading - Yes, you have to change the bag frequently or it will start to stink!",[]
Especially as baby gets older.,[]
Nothing is going to stay odor-free sitting around for a week or two!,[]
We change our bag every 5 days or so and have zero smell problems.,[]
My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!,[]
"As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.",[]
The Diaper Genie was WAY too complicated and an ordinary pail will not work because we have dogs - they would find that much too easy!I highly recommend this product!!!,[]
!,[]
I received my Diaper Champ at my baby shower for the birth of my first son 11 months ago.,[]
I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!,[]
I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.,[]
"One thing you might want to be careful of, however...make sure you do not throw loose baby wipes into the Diaper Champ or else the flip mechanism can become jammed and after time will not seal properly due to having to pull out wipes that are stuck.",[]
"I love my diaper champ so much, I have asked for a second one for my upcoming baby shower for my second son.",[]
I am a second time mom who used the rival Diaper Genie the first time around and let me tell you that there is no comparison.,[]
"The Diaper Champ is easy to use, easy to change and uses everyday garbage bags instead of the expensive refills.",[]
"Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.",[]
"The Diaper Champ is not perfect, it sometimes feels as if it has filled up too quickly (i.e.",[]
"maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.",[]
"So, I would strongly recommend that you buy the Diaper Champ and not waste your time, money and patience with the other product.",[]
I don't think I would have bought the diaper champ if I heard how bad it smelled!,[]
I read all great reviews but I guess people must have left out how bad it stinks all the time.,[]
It does not keep odor out at all.,[]
I have scented trash bags in it and it still gags me when I walk in my daughters room.,[]
I think the way to open it is awfully hard too.,[]
I brake a nail every time or pinch my fingers.,[]
I don't think I would reccommend this to anyone.,[]
It helps save money because you don't have to buy special bags but for the extra money I would have gotten the diaper genie.,[]
"Unfortunatly, I found this out too late!",[]
!,[]
GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.,[]
I used the Diaper Genie for 4 years and had no problems with odor.,[]
"After 4 years and 2 kids it was starting to fall apart, so I decided to buy a diaper champ.",[]
I liked the idea that I didn't have to buy the refills or worry about the twist and changing etc..,[]
"But, the trade off has not been good!",[]
My Diaper champ does not hold odor.,[]
"I change the bag 1-2 times per week, but my child's room still stinks every time I enter.",[]
I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray.,[]
I would not recommend this product to a friend.,[]
I just bought the Diaper Champ last week.,[]
It's really easy to use and I am not having any smell issues yet.,[]
"Right now, his diapers don't smell too bad normally, so we'll see what happens when he starts going to solids.",[]
"Sometimes it doesn't completely go down when you flip it, but other than that, I really like it.",[]
"I wasn't willing to get the Diaper Genie (either one), because with everything else, I don't want the added cost of special bags.",[]
"With the Diaper Champ, you can use any bag, and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.Update: We are at nearly 6 months, and he has been eating solids for about 2 weeks now.",[]
Still no smell issues until you go to empty is out.,[]
It is still something I would recommend.,[]
"The only other thing I might possibly see as an issue might be that it doesn't hold a lot, but if it held anymore, the bags would weigh a TON!",[]
"Either way, it is still working great for me!",[]
"{edit} We are now at 16 months, and it still works great for us.",[]
"I'm only six months pregnant, but needed a diaper pail for two toddlers who were visiting our house last weekend.",[]
"I wasn't sure about buying this after reading some of the negative reviews, but it looked like it might work.",[]
"Well, the kids used it all weekend, and then after they left, I totally forgot to empty it (I'm new to this mom thing!)",[]
"until now, five days later.",[]
"I figured the diapers just didn't stink, because the room smelled fine until I opened up the Diaper Champ... well, they stunk all right!",[]
The Champ just did a great job of sealing the odors in.I'm really pleased I got this now.,[]
"I figure if it holds a weekend's worth of smelly diapers from two solids-eating toddlers with no odor at all for nearly a week, it'll work great for our newborn in a few months!",[]
I too agree that this diaper pail is the best!!,[]
Forget about having to buy special bags for your diaper genie that create little diaper sausages...this pail is sealed so tight that you don't smell a thing until you open it to dispose of the REGULAR KITCHEN BAGS you use in it.,[]
That to me was the feature that sealed the deal.,[]
"My son is 8 weeks old and when he first came home I went out and bought a box of kitchen bags, threw them in the bottom of the pail and I haven't even gone through that first box of bags yet.",[]
Our baby shares a room with us and we have the Diaper Champ about two feet away from our bed and can't smell a thing...and I have a power nose - I can always smell everything and have never even gotten a whiff.,[]
BUY THIS ITEM - it is the best!,[]
!,[]
"My son is now 11months old, and this is the only diaper pail I have had, but I would definetly try something else for my next child.The good things about this diaper pail are the price, and it is easy to use and change the bags.",[]
It doesn't require any special bags which is cost efficent.The thing I can't stand about it and the reason I only gave it 2 stars is because of the smell.,[]
My childs room always smells like I just changed his diaper.,[]
"I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.",[]
"It still smells, so I would not recommend this product.",[]
We received the Diaper Champ for our son about 2 years ago and loved it.,[]
"It really did the job.. kept the smells inside, used garbage bags, worked great.",[]
"Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.",[]
"Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.",[]
"Sure, cute to look at... but if you have a fill it up (a huge no-no with the new one) then you have to pull it through the narrow opening to get the bag out.Talk about saying a few prayers in hopes it doesn't rip.",[]
It's very frustrating.,[]
"The old one was straight out, straight back in.",[]
I am not sure what they were thinking when the designed the bottom larger than the top.,[]
It's like trying to get something out of a coke bottle.. but stinkier.,[]
The old one...,[]
I give a thumbs up.... the new... well.... let's just say be very careful when emptying it.,[]
We love our Diaper Champ because you can use regular kitchen bags.,[]
We have to dump it every other day because it fills up so we are so glad we do not have to buy special expensive bags for it.,[]
"We registered for this diaper pail before I had my son, who is now just over 2 1/2....we LOVED it until about a month ago.",[]
"We noticed that the pail started to smell a little, which hadn't occurred that frequently in the two-ish years since we brought it home.",[]
"After a little inspecting, I thought I noticed a diaper jammed between the side fo the pail and the ""Spinny"" thing with the plunger that actually pushes the diaper into the bag.",[]
"I dispatched husband with screwdriver to take the thing apart to free the ""jammed"" diaper.",[]
"He came out about 15 minutes later, and said that the stinky thing wasn't a diaper, it was some sort of padding that was inserted by the manufacturer to keep the darn thing quiet as you push the handle to dispose of the diaper into the bag.",[]
"For the first time, we have a constant odor of urine in our son's room.",[]
I will probably throw the darn thing away...we'll be potty training soon and won't need it for much longer.,[]
"Besides, we take the regular trash out about once a day anyway.",[]
It was a great diaper pail until then!,[]
!,[]
We refused to buy the Diaper Genie because of the mandatory refill bags-too much money !,[]
The first diaper pail we had was nowhere near as good.,[]
"The top opened to put the diaper in and you could see right in, ie, smell right in.",[]
My toddler could flip the lid and ended up breaking it.,[]
We bought the Champ 2 months ago and it paid for itself right away.,[]
"A little hard to open until you get the hang of it, but other than that, it's great.",[]
My toddler even puts her diapers in and I never have to worry about her getting inside the pail.,[]
There is NO WAY she can open it.,[]
It's wonderful !!!,[]
I also buy the kitchen bags from the dollar store and we usually use 2 bags a week.,[]
Definitely the best !!,[]
!,[]
This is a fine product and I am happy with it.,[]
"I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now, I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad.",[]
My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag.,[]
My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to doesn't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning.,[]
"Great size, we only change each week but after 5 months the smell started to seep through and the nursery after 8 months is smelling too much of diapers now, despite airfreshners etc.",[]
"If my baby used this as a bedroom, he sleeps with us I would have replaced this sooner !!",[]
I even washed it all our in bleach but the seals must have gone as its just getting worse.,[]
I like the size though and love the fact you just put the diaper in dirty and swing the top over.,[]
One problem with this is when it gets full the diapers get stuck - thats not very pleasent too.Going to BabyRUs this morning as after 8 months I decided today is the day its ready totally for a new one.,[]
"We decided to go with the champ just because you dont have to buy those expensive refills, boy and i glad we did!",[]
"I buy CHEAP scented trash bags and change it every three to four days and have had no problems with the smell and my son eats solids and his diapers are pretty gross, as long as you CHANGE THE BAG you will love this it really is the CHAMP OF DIRTY DIAPERS!!!!!",[]
!,[]
We absolutely LOVE the CHAMP!,[]
It does a great job of keeping diaper odor out of our son's room.,[]
We love that it uses regular trash bags and so we are not spending more money on Genie refills.,[]
We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.,[]
"If there is a super stinky diaper, we just seal it up in plastic grocery sacks and put it in the big trash can in the garage.",[]
"It is impossible for any diaper pail to lock out all stinkiness.Also, for the complaints that the champ is difficult to open:  I would rather my son not be able to get it open than have a pail that is too easy to open.",[]
"Well, no one in my family can figure out how to use the diaper genie.",[]
"With two babies born within 3 weeks of each other, my sister in law and I decided to try the diaper champ.",[]
Her Aunt sent her the diaper genie and none of us can figure it out.,[]
The Champ is so easy!!!,[]
No expensive refills!!!,[]
We have not noticed any smells and a Wal-Mart bag can hold a lot.,[]
I would change the bag often to avoid overfilling the bag abd having diapers get stuck.,[]
"Overall, this is the best baby accessory we own!!!",[]
!,[]
I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ.,[]
"It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn't contain the smell.",[]
Babies 'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again.,[]
I would say it's a product default.,[]
"We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out.",[]
"Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they're soaked, it wouldn't fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we'd have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers.",[]
I'm pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails.,[]
I bought this as a gift for a friend's baby shower and they really adore it.,[]
It's a great invention and they've really put it to good use after the baby was born.,[]
This thing really hits the mark!!!,[]
"Inexpensive, economical, effective and super easy to use!",[]
!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.,[]
No special bags or canisters.We really love this diaper system... And if any diapers dirty the unit while your loading just simply wipe it with a wet wipe and you are back in bussiness!,[]
!This one really does Knock Out The Competition!,[]
!Update 7/30/05 - So far has performed like a champ.,[]
"Using normal bags is a big plus!Having only had breastfed poopy diapers (which aren't as smelly as regular poopy diapers) in this up until now, i really cant' comment on its complete and total efectiveness against really stinky poops, but for the breastfed diapers it has been low or no maintenance and odor free!Easy to use, inexpensive and odor free are why this reviewer feels that the Diaper Champ, for now, still stands as an Undefeated Heavyweight!","[('odor', 0.10955683499513391)]"
!,[]
"I TRIED A ""DIAPER CHAMP"" FOR MY SECOND BABY.",[]
I BOUGHT THE DIAPER CHAMP BECAUSE IT USED REGULAR TRASH BAGS AND I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE MORE ECONOMICAL THAN THE PRICEY DIAPER PAIL REFILLS ON OTHER DIAPER PAILS(I FIRST USED A DIAPER GENIE OVER 12 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE FIRST OUT.,[]
I DID NOTICE SOME ODOR BACK THEN BUT BEING AN EXHAUSTED FIRST TIME MOM I PUT IT DOWN TO ME NOT CLEANING THE PAIL...HEY THE INSTRUCTIONS DID NOT SAY TO DO THAT AND I FIGURED THE POOPY WAS IN THE BAG ANYWAY)....BACK TO THE CHAMP...,[]
THE DIAPER CHAMP DID GREAT...AT FIRST - I EVEN CLEANED IT WITH ANTIBACTERIAL WIPES IN BETWEEN EMPTYNG THE THING.,[]
"BUT ALAS THE DAY CAME WHEN MY BABY HAD TO START SOLID FOODS, AND THE STINKIES GOT STINKIER, BY THE TIME I WEANED HER ONTO FORMULA AT NEARLY 9 MONTHS OLD THE DIAPER CHAMP HAD SEEN IT'S LAST DAYS.",[]
THE STINK WAS SO BAD MY HUSBAND AND I PLAYFULLY ARGUED ABOUT WHOSE TURN IT WOULD BE TO EMPTY THE THING!,[]
WE BOUGHT A DIAPER GENIE IN HOPES THAT WE COULD BANISH THE STINKS.,[]
AT THAT POINT THE PRICE OF THE REFILLS BECAME OF NO OBJECT...THE POOPY DESIGNER ROOM FRAGRANCE HAD TO GO.....THE DIAPER GENIE LASTED ONE DAY IN MY HOUSE.,[]
THE STINK WAS WRETCHED EVERY TIME WE OPENED THE TOP TO LOAD A DIAPER IN....AND IT WAS EVEN STINKIER EMPTYING THE QUARTER-FILLED PAIL......ALL IN ALL A MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT....DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR CASH ON A GENIE....STINKY AS IT WAS WHEN EMPTYING I AM BACK TO THE DIAPER CHAMP....AT LEAST IT DOES NOT SMELL WHEN I PUT A DIAPER IN.,[]
I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE IT JUST DOES NOT DO THE JOB ALL THE WAY.,[]
"I CAN SOMETIMES SMELL THE POOP IN MY DAUGHTER'S ROOM, ESPECIALLY IF THE DOOR WAS CLOSED, BUT IT CERTAINLY IS NO WORSE, AND IN MY BOOKS SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN THE GENIE",[]
"As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter.",[]
"I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions.",[]
"While at someone's house, I saw the Diaper Champ.",[]
It was one that I hadn't seen very much in the various stores I shopped in.,[]
"I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!",[]
"!When I bought it, I didn't have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!!",[]
It is so simple to figure out how to use!,[]
"My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!",[]
)I've even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You'll love it!,[]
My girlfriend said to get this and I love it.It is so easy and simple to use.,[]
"Just put the diaper in the top and flip the handle..and it's gone.You use your own garbage bags, which is great.It doesn't let the odors out.Everyone that comes to our home asks about it, when they see it..and think it's great.a must have item.",[]
We have been using the Diaper Champ for just about 9 months.,[]
We have loved it until recently.,[]
It has been great.,[]
LAtely we have been smelling diapers in my son's room.,[]
We have decided that since it worked so well that we will be buying another one this weekend.,[]
We like that we can use regular bags and do not need to buy special ones.,[]
Since this product is not too expensive we have decided to buy another.,[]
This product is awful.,[]
It does not hold odors at all.,[]
"I have read in other reviews about how you have to constantly clean and use disinfectant, etc.",[]
Why wouldn't I just use a covered trashcan then?,[]
The whole purpose of this is to keep odors out of the house.,[]
"My wife, who recently had our second child, was overcome with the smell during her second pregnancy, to the point where she never put a poopy diaper in the Diaper Champ.",[]
"We have another diaper dispoal system for our new baby (forgive me for forgetting the name), and it works great.",[]
I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ.,[]
"BUT, it really isn't that great in controlling odor.",[]
"Sometimes diapers get stuck in the ""flipping tube"" and then you have to open it and pull it out... what a mess!",[]
It isn't all that easy to clean either.,[]
I would not recommend this to anyone!,[]
Its really easy but it smells all the time.,[]
You could smell it down the hallway it was so bad.,[]
We even bought the air fresheners that you plug into the wall and it didn't improve the smell at all.,[]
I still use it for wet diapers but if there is a dirty one I take it outside to the trash can so it doesn't smell up my house.Try anything but the diaper champ.,[]
"After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.",[]
I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers.,[]
"Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the ""Champ"" is in the back corner of the room.",[]
I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room.,[]
We've now had the Diaper Champ for a little over a year!,[]
We love it.,[]
It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!,[]
I highly recommend it.,[]
Drawbacks: it doesn't hold that many diapers at a time.,[]
We have 2 in dapers and we changes it 3 times a week or so.,[]
It needs to be cleaned pretty often or lots of mold and bacteria start to grow (on the parts you can't see until you take it apart).,[]
Lastly part of the fabric/plastic material has ripped on part of it so it is a bit harder to flip back in forth when you  put new dirty diapers in!,[]
"Overall, this is a great product!",[]
"Being a first time Mom, people were overloading me with advice including what diaper pail to purchase.",[]
Some said the Diaper Genie and some said the Diaper Champ and then there was another brand recommended.,[]
I did some research to see what other parents were using online here at Babies-R-Us and decided to go with the Diaper Champ.,[]
I love it!,[]
"No special bags to purchase, no odors, not too bulky.",[]
Works great and I would highly recommend this product.,[]
"After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.",[]
It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant.,[]
"Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!!",[]
"The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.",[]
The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!,[]
The Diaper Champ is a must have for your nursery!,[]
"I had a Diaper Genie, and that thing was horrible!",[]
"A pain to maneuver, empty, etc.",[]
The Diaper Champ is so easy to use and empty.,[]
"While it doesn't completely mask the odor of all poopy diapers, it does a pretty good job.",[]
I can't think of how a diaper trash can could realistically be any better.,[]
We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby.,[]
We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2.,[]
"After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.",[]
Here's a short list of the main reasons I'd recommend this against diaper genie:5.,[]
Diaper Champ doesn't use expensive refills like the genie.,[]
We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie.,[]
"On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills.",[]
"With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club.",[]
We change the bag 1-2x weekly.,[]
"The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15.",[]
(The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags.,[]
Don't.,[]
They're way too small and don't hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4.,[]
The Champ holds a lot more than the genie.,[]
Less frequent emptying.3.,[]
The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills.,[]
"Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill.",[]
Pain.,[]
Changing the refill was just annoying.,[]
"When the refill runs out, there's not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag.",[]
I don't need that.,[]
"And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into.",[]
"With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can.",[]
The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2.,[]
The genie broke after about 15 months.,[]
There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag.,[]
The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1.,[]
"And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It's perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong.",[]
"Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it.",[]
"We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.",[]
"No, it's not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn.",[]
Every single time someone got it wrong.,[]
"So, the Diaper Champ.",[]
you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it's gone.,[]
"I can't think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who've used it so far, don't need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.",[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
It keeps the diapers from stinking up your room/house.,[]
I also love that I can use regualer old kitchen bags and dont' have to fork over extra bucks for special bags.,[]
The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish that it held more diapers.,[]
I got this pail so I wouldn't have to buy special bags.,[]
I had the Diaper Genie with my first child and the odor was too bad with it.,[]
I decided to try this pail and it has worked fine.,[]
"There is some odor, but not like the Diaper Genie.",[]
I use regular trash bags and only put wet diapers in it.,[]
This is good for the price and great that you dont have to buy those pricey refills.,[]
We bought this diaper pail for our first baby because we didn't want to have to keep buying the refills for the other diaper pails and we also heard from other people that they still smell.,[]
"So we purchased this one, and we are completely statisfied.",[]
We have it in our son's room and it doesn't smell at all.,[]
It's very easy to change the bags and it locks nice and tight.,[]
We purchase 30 gallon trash bags and they fit perfectly.,[]
But the best thing is that there is no smell at all.,[]
It's absolutely perfect.,[]
I love this product!,[]
We looked at all of the diaper pail options and finally decided on the Diaper Champ -- and am very glad we did!,[]
"The pail keeps our now 7 month old's dirty, smelly, diapers neatly contained and odor-free.",[]
The only time we smell the diapers at all is when we are changing the bag -- and we've found that using scented bags helps during this process too.,[]
"All in all, the best diaper pail product out there!",[]
We started with the Neat system and was very unhappy with it!,[]
"Thought about the Diaper Genie, but did not want to be tied down to specific replacment bags, so we went with the Champ.",[]
Al though it does not contain the smell all that well it is well worth the money to be abel to use regular bags.,[]
I use Glad Scented kitchen bags and they help.,[]
I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.,[]
Most regular poopie and pee diapers though are well contained and only needs to be changed once a week.,[]
On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.,[]
"I have never had a diaper jam or a broken nail, but you do have to open it carefully as it is tight.",[]
I love this item.,[]
It doesn't stink like the Diaper Genie and is definitely not as complicated to use.,[]
Just insert diaper and pull handle.,[]
No special bags.,[]
Just make sure that your diaper is properly closed (no tape hanging around) because that can cause jambs.,[]
"I chose this product because unlike the Diaper Genie you don't have to buy replacement bags, just pop in a tall kitchen garbage bag which we all have in our homes anyway.",[]
I have twin boys and this product works great.,[]
I recommend spraying it with Lysol and letting it air dry in between bag changes.,[]
This works for me.,[]
It also holds a lot of diapers.,[]
I highly recommend it!,[]
I'm SO glad that we asked the sales associate at Babies R Us for help when picking out a diaper pail.,[]
"We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use.",[]
All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.,[]
There's no twisting and no special liners to buy.,[]
"As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they're not changed often enough.",[]
We don't have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).,[]
When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.,[]
We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.,[]
"Before buying ANY other diaper pail, compare it to this one first.",[]
You'll be amazed at how easy it is to use.,[]
So easy to use.,[]
So good at containing odor.,[]
So nice not to have to buy special trash bags.,[]
It's a great product!!,[]
!,[]
Stay away from the other brands that require special refill bags.,[]
What a waste of money!,[]
"Even the ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills.",[]
"I can't imagine why anyone would want to constantly buy expensive refills for a diaper pail, when a simple trash bag is all you need.As for the ""smell"" issue.",[]
Let's face it - diapers stink.,[]
"And regardless of brand, ANY DIAPER PAIL WILL NEED TO BE EMPTIED ON A REGULAR BASIS.",[]
I really think some people don't realize this.,[]
"When I first had my son, I bought a diaper champ to keep at my mom's house.",[]
"When my mom used to change him, she'd dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ, but didn't change the pail.",[]
After about a week she complained because it started to stink.,[]
"I had to explain to her that it wasn't a ""magic pail"", it was still just a covered trash bin.",[]
"(honestly, how did she raise 2 kids?...)",[]
"Now, mom's back on track and loving her Diaper Champ.As far as the odor issue goes, I have seen no difference in odor control between the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel, but neither are odor proof.",[]
This product is amazing.,[]
It is easy to change.,[]
It uses regular bags.,[]
It's odor free.,[]
"And best of all, you can put the diaper in it and flip the handle with one hand.",[]
I absolutely love it.,[]
I had the Diaper Genie before this and was so unhappy with it.,[]
It broke within 2 weeks of when I started using it.,[]
"I bought the Diaper Champ for a friend off of her registry, and after seeing how it worked, I bought one for myself.",[]
I love this product.,[]
It is a must for anyone with a child in diapers.,[]
We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.,[]
You do need to change it a little more frequently as the solid foods start (2 or 3 times a week) but that eliminates any odors.,[]
We use tall kitchen bags that have the odor patch on them.,[]
All our friends who have the diaper genie regret their choice after they try ours.,[]
"Easy to use, no special bags.",[]
I used the Diaper Genie with our first child and I hated it.,[]
We decided to try something new with our second child.,[]
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.,[]
Here's our solution:USE THE INDIVIDUAL DIAPER DISPOSAL BAGS YOU CAN GET AT TOYS-R-US OR A .99 CENT TYPE STORE WITH THIS PRODUCT!You can get about 50 - 100 bags for about a buck.,[]
"They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!",[]
"If you use them with your poopy diapers before you put them in the Diaper Champ, there's no chance of making a mess on the pail and it helps keep the odor contained.I'm giving the product 4 starts instead of 5 because some people might not like having to buy the extra bags.",[]
"The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.",[]
"As much as people have suggested that you make sure the poopy diaper is secure, there are just some poopy diapers that can never be fully contained without some extra help.",[]
"Love it, love it, love it!",[]
This lives up to the hype.,[]
You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.,[]
"You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.",[]
"It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.",[]
I have recommended this to all new parents!,[]
I registered for this item thinking that I would really need it in my nursery.,[]
After a year and a half we finally gave it away because we never really used it.,[]
"Here are the reasons why:1) We live in an apartment and my son's bedroom is small, so space is valuable and this item took up too much.2) We didn't really see the need for it because after the first month, we didn't really have that many dirty diapers and so it took a long time for it to be filled up.",[]
"Because of this we didn't empty as often as it probably needs to and after about three days, we could start to smell the odor a little.",[]
I hated having to empty it when there were only two or three diapers because I felt it was a waste of garbage bags.,[]
"It was just more convenient to set small garbage can out on the back porch which we could easily empty it when we took out the trash everyday.3) Once my son was able to walk, he would put his toys in the top and flip the lever and it was a pain for me to get them out.I don't know, lots of other people like this pail and have found it useful.",[]
We just didn't use it enough because of our situation.,[]
Maybe my reasons for not buying it aren't good enough.,[]
You can be the judge.,[]
"If you really want a diaper pail, than this may be a good fit for you, but I just think that it isn't a necessity if you are on a tight budget and you are low on space.",[]
I have been very happy with this pail.,[]
The greatest thing... regular trash bags!!,[]
The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND!,[]
Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor.,[]
I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.,[]
"If the plunger is not going down, it's because you need to change the bag!",[]
!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes.,[]
"It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing!",[]
:),[]
This diaper pail worked great - until my daughter started eating solid foods.,[]
When she was strictly breastfed her poop had no foul odor.,[]
Once her poop started to smell the smell started leaking out.,[]
She is 17 months old now and we are off to buy a Diaper Genie.,[]
"Sure, it may be more complicated and a bit more expensive, but right now we are having to change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ every time she poops.",[]
It's such a smelly hassle!,[]
The entire room stinks!,[]
We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.,[]
My advice - buy the Diaper Genie.,[]
In the long run you'll thank me.,[]
"I can't imagine that I am using this product incorrectly, but just last night I walked down the hall and really noticed the nursery smells like a dirty diaper.",[]
"I had noticed it before, but never really thought that the Diaper Champ was claimed to be ""odor-free.""",[]
"Sorry, but I don't buy it.",[]
"Maybe little baby diapers and areas associated with them will just inherently smell like pooh, but if it claims to contain odors, it falls short.",[]
"I don't know if we will bother to try another model/brand, but for the time being, I am buying a scent-masking spray/device to help tone the scent down.",[]
"I love the little guy, but wow he can put out a scent.",[]
I really think this is a wonderful product.,[]
"Our son is 3 months old, we received the Champ as a shower gift, and have been using it since his birth.",[]
My husband has a SUPER-HERO sense of smell and has not complained once about any odor from the Champ.,[]
I love that you can use regular garbage bags and can't imagine running to the store to buy expensive refills.,[]
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.,[]
Though the Diaper Champ resembles a storm trooper from Star Wars it really does the job and I recommend it highly.,[]
"This is the first diaper pail I have owned, but I have no complaints.",[]
It is very easy to use as you can dump the diaper with one hand.,[]
I have never noticed a smell in my nursery even when we change the bag.,[]
"This product uses regular kitchen sized trash bags which is great.The bags are pretty easy to change and the best part is that the unit holds the top of the bag closed so you can cinch it with your hands and twist it up before any ""stinky air"" can escape.",[]
"My husband is the weakest when it comes to ""poopy"" and he never complains about changing the bag or using the ""champ"".",[]
I definitely reccomend this product to new parents.,[]
I am a soldier currently deployed in Iraq and this is my first child.,[]
"(Boy, and good looking just like his dad)  Anyway, i heard about the ""Diaper Genie"".",[]
I heard it was good but you had to buy their bags.,[]
Then i read up on this one and ordered it because it can use any normal sized garbage bag.,[]
"I went home on leave, two days late of the birth, and got to use it.",[]
Best investment I made.,[]
He would make the nastiest smelling diapers and that thing just took it like a champ.,[]
i swear its air-tight.,[]
Definately recommend to anyone not wanting to empty the trash everytime he/she goes (12 a day).,[]
Outstanding!!,[]
!,[]
"After using this for 3 years, I still stunned that other people still use the Diaper Genie.",[]
"I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.",[]
"If anyone is having trouble, though, try:  a)  wrapping the tabs securely around the diaper; b)  using deodorant trash bags;  and c)  taking dirty diapers straight outside to the trash and using your diaper pail just for wet diapers.",[]
"I bought this 3 years ago under the recommendation of my sister, used it with my first child, am using it with my second and have recommended it to all of my friends.",[]
"Like the other reviews say, your diaper pail will stink and nothing is 100% odor proof.",[]
To control the slight odor I have found a couple solutions: 1)put a room freshener or the perfume tear outs from magazines at the bottom 2)but scented trash bags (still cheaper than other diaper pail refills).,[]
I love the easy handle to turn so even my older one can help me throw away baby's diaper.,[]
I researched prior to purchasing the genie...loved it!!,[]
No smell.,[]
But the refills where an additional cost I didn't want to pay for.,[]
After the cutting mechanism broke on the genie I bought the champ.,[]
"Yes it holds dirty diapers, yes you have to clean it, and yes it sits in our garage because the smell of dirty diapers is way too noticable.",[]
If you are worried about oder...don't get the champ.,[]
I will give it a thumbs up for convenience.,[]
My 18mo old puts her own diapers in the champ (in the garage) and turns the lever.,[]
Just don't let it get too full or you can't turn the lever...that makes since though doesn't it??,[]
?,[]
"No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.",[]
I do not recommend this product.,[]
"With our first child, we bought a cheap diaper pail figuring they were all the same.",[]
"However, the odor was not trapped inside the pail, making the entire room smell.",[]
"So, we decided to shop around for a better diaper pail for our second child.",[]
The Diaper Champ is the one we chose & we are 100% satisfied with it.,[]
We absolutely love it!,[]
The odor stays inside the diaper pail & doesn't escape out.,[]
I definitely recommend the Diaper Champ.,[]
It is well worth it's money!,[]
"In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!",[]
We figured we would give the Diaper Champ a try after reading reviews on this website.,[]
We LOVE it.,[]
It is soooo much easier too use than the Diaper Genie.,[]
There is also the added bonus of not having too buy those refils.,[]
I really like the one-handed operation of the Diaper Champ.,[]
You can have baby in one arm and still put the diaper in its place.,[]
We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!,[]
Its also nice too just be able too drop the diaper in the hole instead of having too shove the diaper down into the thing like you have too with the Diaper Genie.Highly Recommend!!!,[]
!,[]
"OK - my husband used to leave restaraunts when a couple with a baby in a diaper came in, but he doesn't even mind emptying the Diaper Champ at all.",[]
"(I know that's mostly because he's responsibile for those diapers now, but it's still a great product!)",[]
"We have NEVER noticed a diaper odor anywhere, not even while replacing the bag.Every time one of my husband's friends' wives gets pregnant, my husband buys the guy the Diaper Champ, AND THEY ALL LOVE IT!We have much less diaper odor than my firends with same-age babies have with Diaper Genie.",[]
"Also, they say that when you change bags in Diaper Genie, the stench is unbearable.",[]
"There isn't a bag-changing smell with Diaper Champ, because the diapers do get some air when the top is flipped to add a diaper.",[]
"Aerobic decomposition smells better than anaerobic decomposition, and whatever is going on in there, you smell it when you change bags.We do empty it twice a week (it gets full that often, anyway).It did get stuck a couple of times when it was WAY TOO FULL.",[]
"Letting it get too full and leaving it too long may contribute to odor issues, too.Not having to buy special bags saves us lots of time, hassle, and money.I do have one friend who ""retired"" hers to the back porch because of odor.",[]
"Her daughter was nearly two years old by then, and the contents of her diapers are a lot different from the contents of an infant's diapers.",[]
"Very easy to use, and not a single smell escapes.",[]
Also great that you don't have additional expense of special garbage bags.,[]
"Though...now that we have had this for almost two years, it is starting to smell from the bottom.",[]
"But in looking at the new design, I think they fixed that.",[]
Sill would give 5 starss.,[]
At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie.,[]
"You put the diaper in the top, then flip the handle over and it is supposed to compress it and dump it in the bottom.",[]
"However, after a while the diper and wipes get stuck when you flip the handle over.",[]
I have to pull them out by hand which is really gross!,[]
The problem gets worse as the pail gets full.,[]
Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.,[]
A regular trash can with a flip-top lip and a good seal would be better and probably a lot cheaper.,[]
This product is horrible.,[]
It does not keep the odor from soiled diapers in.,[]
The entire baby's room stunk of poop.,[]
We had to put it outside on the deck to keep it from smelling the house up.,[]
Horrible horrible product.,[]
Don't waste your money on this.,[]
This is a great diaper pail.,[]
My husband and I choose this one mainly because it uses regular garbage bags but we've been VERY happy with it for other reasons as well.,[]
It's extremely easy to operate with one hand and it does an amazing job containing the smell.,[]
"Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.",[]
The appearance of the latch is deceiving - it makes you think you open it one way when it's really another.,[]
"Once I learned the correct way to open it, it's very easy.",[]
I was recommended this by a fellow mom before we had our daughter and purchased it from Baby's R Us.,[]
It's fabulous!,[]
We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it!,[]
We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great.,[]
We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!!,[]
"A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it, my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days, it does begin to smell, but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days.",[]
"So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!",[]
:-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!,[]
"The diaper champ is easy to use, save money on special bags, and contains odor.",[]
"This is a GREAT VALUE, and does the job like a CHAMP!!",[]
!,[]
I love this product!,[]
It is simple to assemble and easy to use.,[]
"It takes regular trash bags, so there's no refills to worry about.",[]
"Best of all, it really does work to control odor.",[]
"I only change the bag every 2-3 days, and you'd never know it!",[]
I loved this compared to the genie.,[]
It is easier to use and less costly in the long run!,[]
!Two thumbs up!!,[]
"!Now, only if it would spray a freshner on its own.",[]
LOL!!,[]
!,[]
We got the Diaper Champ because we thought it was smart to use regular garbage bags and not pay for the diaper Genie refills.,[]
BIG MISTAKE!,[]
"This product does not keep odor in, and when you open it up to put in a new bag in, its all over.",[]
My daughter's room stinks because of this product and we are in the process of trying to find a REAL odorless diaper pail.,[]
"I really liked it in the beginning, especially how easy it was to use.",[]
"But as time has gone by, it has really begun to allow odors to escape, or it is absorbing them I don't know which, but it really SMELLS!",[]
"I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.",[]
I'll be buying something else this weekend.,[]
I returned the Diaper G**** that I was given but kept this!,[]
It takes ANY garbage bag (no expensive refills) and is wonderful for controlling odor... that's especially important now that our little guy is eating solid food and making more stinky diapers!,[]
I started out with the diaper genie.,[]
Everyone said &quot;you wont be disappointed.&quot; Boy were they wrong.,[]
After a few months I threw it out.,[]
I went back to babiesrus and searched for a better product.,[]
I FOUND IT!!,[]
!the diaper champ works great.,[]
I don't need to spend money on disposable bags...any bag will do.,[]
"To help with the odor, I found if you use cinnamin scented pinecones at the bottom of the pail, it really helps elliminate the odor.",[]
I don't even smell it.,[]
This is a wonderful product and it holds a great amount of diapers.,[]
We put the poo poo diapers in plastic newspaper bags before throwing them into the pail.,[]
I can still fit several more in than I could with the diaper genie.,[]
I can't say enough about this product.,[]
"Please if you register for the diaper genie, cross it off your list and by the diaper champ.",[]
This product also saves you a lot of money and a lot of trips to the garbage can!!,[]
!,[]
"We opted for this pail since we are cloth diapering, and the product works for cloth diapers.",[]
"My son is nearly a year old, and we have found that the Diaper Champ, emptied 2-3 times per week and cleaned regularly, is very good at containing odors.",[]
"As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.",[]
"Because of this, we've moved from the Diaper Champ to a wetbag on a hook-it works better for cloth and takes up less space.",[]
"My husband saw this after my first shower and said ""What's that thing for?""",[]
He now loves it.,[]
I do too.,[]
"Best of all, you don't have to buy specific bags, we use the bags from the grocery and they do quite well.",[]
"We've bought some air freshener cans and put them in the bottom, because after 8 months of use, it's going to smell.",[]
"But the room does not carry the smell, only when you're on the floor near the genie.",[]
My only issue is that I've broken a nail or two lifting the latch to get the top open.,[]
But it's infinitely better than having the smell!,[]
!,[]
Wonerful and easy!,[]
I love that you can use regular garbadge bags.,[]
It pretty much lets you know when it's full and it's time to change the bag.,[]
"Plus, I've never had any odor problems with it.",[]
We recently bought the Diaper Champ as a replacement for our frustrating Diaper Genie.,[]
"With a 13mos old and another due this fall, we knew we needed something better, and we certainly found it.",[]
"I love this diaper pail, love not having to by special refills, and it controls oder very well.",[]
We are very happy with our Diaper Champ and will reccomend it to all of our friends who are having babies.,[]
We received the Diaper Champ as a shower gift.,[]
It worked great for the 1st 5 months.,[]
"As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.",[]
I highly recommend this item.,[]
It is a must!,[]
I registered for the diaper genie and used it for about a week and couldn't stand it.,[]
"It broke,the refills are expensive and very hard to install.",[]
Then I got the diaper champ.,[]
What a difference.,[]
"Easy to use, just one hand, and no odors.",[]
It uses just your basic tall garbage bags.,[]
So you don't have to go out and buy special bags for it.,[]
"When my daughter (now 8 months old) was younger, and her diapers were smaller, the Diaper Champed worked well.",[]
"But now that her diapers are bigger (and stinkier) I find that the Champ only holds about 10-12 diapers before getting jammed, especially if we put wipes in it along with diapers.",[]
Another thing is the velcro on the diapers often gets stuck and it's difficult to flip the diapers into the bottom of the container.,[]
"Another problem is the smell, the champ doesn't seem to contain odors any better than putting diapers into a regular trash can.",[]
"I've never used any other diaper disposal container so I don't know how this one compares, but I am now looking for a new one b/c the Diaper Champ just isn't cutting it for me.",[]
Half the time I end up just throwing the dirty diapers into a waste basket to avoid the hassle.,[]
This product was silly to me until my husband insisted me to put on up on my baby registry.,[]
I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money.,[]
"Then again, it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table.",[]
"One, its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom.",[]
"Two, no mess.",[]
"Three, its very easy to use (all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper).",[]
"Well, my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED: 1/9/06At first I said it was great.",[]
But now I'm saying it stinks.,[]
It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself.,[]
Such a hastle right?,[]
"I think so, so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP.",[]
It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!,[]
if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.,[]
"I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full, you will throw the trash away.",[]
Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars.,[]
"My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills.",[]
The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags.,[]
Plus it's simple to use.,[]
We haven't had a problem with odor at all.,[]
It's a great product!,[]
I have a 10 year old daughter and an 8 month old son.,[]
There was nothing like this when I had my first child and I really looked into the champ v's genie before I brought this and I have to say that I truly LOVE it.,[]
I change the bag once a week.,[]
My kids have to share a room so if it was smelly I would hear about it.,[]
I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.,[]
"Aside form that it is so easy to use with one hand, anyone with a wiggly baby will appreciate that.",[]
In fact I love it so much I am going to take one all the way to Australia with me for my niece since she can't get them over there.,[]
"I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.",[]
"Here is a 3 step plan to save your money on either of these ""pails"" AND on the bags.",[]
AND keep a cleaner house at the same time.1.,[]
Put the dirty diaper in an old Wal-Mart or other grocery bag.2.,[]
Twist and tie the bag tightly.,[]
Repeat if really bad.3.,[]
Walk the bag out to the trash outside if it smells really bad.Total Cost $0.00.Remember only you can prevent your house from being a LANDFILL!,[]
"To put it simply, this is a necessary item for every home with a baby..-no refill bags (tip--can store extra empty bags inside in the bottom)-easy to empty & clean-no odors-not big & bulky",[]
I have an 8 week old and thus far it has been a wonderful product.,[]
"There is no odor, and changing bags is easy and clearly less expensive than having to buy special filters or other bags.",[]
We are very pleased.,[]
The only diaper pail I've found that can easily be used one-handed!,[]
"Not only that, but you don't have to buy special garbage bags.",[]
You can use regular kitchen trash bags.,[]
"This is easy, but horribly smelly.",[]
I suggest saving your money and buying a regular trash can.,[]
"You will get the same effect, because this doesn't do anything special.",[]
"When I registered for this, I took my sister in law with me, who herself is a mother of two.",[]
"She told of her horror stories with her sticky diaper pales, but said that she never tried this one, I liked it for the simple fact you can use your own garbage bags, no need to spend extra money for refills.",[]
Its light weight and can be moved easily and for cleaning.,[]
I have two stories in my home and since my daughter was born I have purchased another one for her room.,[]
"I did have a problem with the seal coming off, but emailed customer service and within 24 hours a new seal free of charge was sent out to me, when it arrived, had clear instructions for repair and there were 2 seals.",[]
"Very satisfied with this, really keeps the smell out, easy to use and most of all very easy to hide in a corner",[]
We purchased the Diaper Champ when we were expecting our second baby.,[]
Our first was still in diapers and we wanted to have a diaper disposal in each of the kids' rooms.,[]
"Well, after one month with the Diaper Champ, we ditched the Genie we had and purchased a second one!",[]
I can't tell you how nice it is not to have to fumble and deal with those refills.,[]
"And a lot less expensive, too.",[]
"The only drawback is that sometimes you can get a slight odor, but it is only occasionally and when one of our daughers has a really bad messy diaper.I totally recommend!",[]
I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.,[]
The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.,[]
The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.,[]
I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.,[]
That would be my only complaint.,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
I change it 2 times a week and have no problem with smell.,[]
Ok - when you open it - it may be a little stinky but it has dirty diapers in it!!!!,[]
"With the lid closed, however, no smell issue at all.We love that it takes regular bags  - we buy the least expensive kitchen bags we can find and they work great!",[]
This item was recommended to me while I was pregnant.,[]
I went with the idea and purchased it.,[]
"At first, it was awesome, when my son's poo wasn't that bad!",[]
He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.,[]
"However, it is WAY better than using a trash can and it smelling up your whole house!",[]
AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!,[]
I definately recommend this product.,[]
I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because there was a little odor and the product desc.,[]
states odor free.,[]
other than that it's great!,[]
I highly recomend the diaper champ.,[]
Had the diaper genie with first child and wasn't happy with having to purchase the refills and having to explain to everyone how to use it.,[]
The diaper champ is easy to use and change.,[]
I have not noticed any oder but I alway fold up the dirty diapers so nothing leaks out maybe the other reviewers just put the dirty diapers right into the top and I could see how that might cause an odor after a while.,[]
This diaper pail is excellent.,[]
No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.,[]
I am very pleased with it.,[]
I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.,[]
They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.,[]
Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out.,[]
I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).,[]
Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.,[]
Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.,[]
"The Diaper Champ arrived to my old address, even after I changed the ""ship to"" address on the amazon.com website.",[]
"I had wanted it shipped to my work address.It finally arrived, in horrible condition.",[]
"It had been opened, and was thrown on my porch.",[]
"It is a good thing it didn't rain, or it would have been ruined.I was very unhappy with the website for not picking my the address change, and also with the unacceptable delivery.",[]
"My baby is admittedly still quite young, but I haven't yet noticed any smell associated with our Diaper Champ, and I think my nose is reasonably sensitive.",[]
"The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.",[]
"The only alteration I'd make would be to add a clear window or some kind of indicator that would let us know when the bag gets full; it's no fun to put a diaper in in the middle of the night and find that things are jamming up because the bag needs changing.Update, seven months later:  I still haven't noticed a smell problem with the Diaper Champ itself.","[('bag', 0.14992257357311034)]"
"However, a couple of issues have emerged:We're using the Diaper Champ for cloth diapers now, since we use cloth almost all the time.",[]
"Although a kitchen trash bag has a large enough capacity to hold a whole washload of diapers, the Diaper Champ doesn't--it jams up when maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of a load has been put in it, so after a while we have to take the bag out and keep filling it outside the Diaper Champ.",[]
"Also, some of the jams have resulted in rough edges on the plastic, and I've cut my hands on the edges several times.",[]
"Not a big deal, and this product is still good, but I'd recommend it more for people who are using disposable diapers than people who are using cloth.",[]
I used a Diaper Genie with my first child and got so tired of buying refills...,[]
They are so difficult to change.,[]
I LOVE my Diaper Champ.,[]
Using kitchen garbage bags is a huge plus.,[]
So easy to change!,[]
I have been giving them as baby gifts!,[]
"My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.",[]
"Beware of putting a soiled ""pull up"" through this system.",[]
A friend did it once and it was a mess!,[]
However you can take the Champ apart and clean it.,[]
Overall a great product.,[]
My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.,[]
The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.,[]
I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.,[]
This product is great in the beginning when you have a tiny baby and tiny diapers.,[]
If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.,[]
"You do have to be sure to fold the diaper into a small ball to get it to fit down the cylander, and tape it shut, otherwise the diaper tabs can get stuck in the cylander as you turn it, and the diaper gets stuck.",[]
"The can itself is pretty small too, so it needs to be emptied frequently (especially if you have twins like we do!",[]
")However, once your baby starts to grow and is in size 3 or 4 diapers, they get stuck even more and it is not a useful.",[]
"Plus, the diapers get really heavy.",[]
We had to use trash compactor bags with it because regular trash bags would tear with the weight of the full pail.,[]
We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.,[]
When rolling it over in dump mode into the bag system it will more times than not catch a diaper and clog the next time you try to insert your next disposal.,[]
"Leaving you to open the system up, reach in and un-clog the stuck diaper.",[]
Needless to say you now have had a nice aroma and had to touch the diaper twice.,[]
Which in I and my wifes opinion could of been resolved with just using a standard trash can with a foot peddle to open.,[]
You will need to change the bags atleast every 3-5 days.,[]
...make sure I tell people about this product.,[]
"I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why.",[]
"I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs.",[]
I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law's house.,[]
"I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won't have a problem) and it works great, good design!",[]
"My baby is two weeks old and I CAN SMELL the accrual of diapers, after the third day you can definitely start to smell a faint odor from all the diapers.",[]
"However, since I have more than one diaper disposal system in my home it wasn't even full however, it began to smell and didn't push the diapers all the way down.",[]
The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.,[]
If you are going to change the diaper champ every single day then you might want to buy it.,[]
"My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.",[]
"Probably any diaper pail will do until your child is about six months old, and then none will work that great.",[]
"Yes, you do have to air them out once in a while, and clean them frequently (yay for Lysol), but the plastic does absorb odors no matter what.",[]
"Our Diaper Champ has reached its limit, and we are going to buy another one.Why another Champ, when it still lets out smells?",[]
All diaper pails smell!!,[]
"Every mother of a two-year-old that I know is going to drastic lengths to air out their pail, no matter what brand they bought.",[]
No one will be reusing theirs for a second child.So I'm getting another Champ because I like these things:- I can use it with one hand and can keep the other hand on my baby- I don't have to buy special refils (I do use odor-fighting garbage bags that really help)- I don't have to explain how to use it to babysitters.That's it.,[]
Hope that helps.,[]
"Before our first child was born, we recieved a Diaper Genie as a gift.",[]
"For 1 1/2 years, it was wonderful.",[]
"There was no smell, no matter how long we waited to empty the diaper pail.",[]
"After that, it smelled all the time.",[]
"Furthermore, we could not get refills at our grocery store, so a special trip to another store was needed to purchase these.For our second child, we purchased the Diaper Champ.",[]
"Like the Diaper Genie, we have no smell yet.",[]
"Our daughter is only 9 months old, so we will have to wait and see how this compares in the coming months.",[]
We have saved ALOT of money on refills!!!!,[]
In 9 months we have spent $2 on bags to refill (we use scented bags from the dollar store...35 for $1)!,[]
"The Diaper Genie refills cost about $42 for the same time period!The ""bottom"" line...1.",[]
NO diaper pail will hold stinky diapers forever without emitting some type of odor.,[]
Empty that diaper pail.,[]
Who wants week-old poop in their house?,[]
How disgusting!!!!2.,[]
The performance of the Diaper Champ is comparable to the Diaper Genie.,[]
In fact it may be better...we have to wait to see.3.,[]
The Diaper Champ saves money!!!!,[]
!DO NOT hesitate to purchase this product!,[]
Those who have had difficulty with it will have difficulty with ALL diaper pails!,[]
"This is by far the better, more economical choice.",[]
I've given this can as a gift a few times now.,[]
"Once to a couple who were on their second child, their response was 'how'd we survive through the first baby without that can'.It's easy, ordourless, and clean.",[]
What more could new parents on.,[]
I have to say that I really love this diaper pail.,[]
It is very easy to use.,[]
All you do is flip the handle and you are done.,[]
You don't have to buy refill bags for this diaper pail.,[]
I just use small trash bags that I already have.,[]
I also use cloth diapers and this pail works wonderfully for that.,[]
I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.,[]
I recommend this product to all my friends who are expecting.,[]
After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.,[]
What a difference!I like that Champ is easy to use and cheap (no special expensive refill bags) but it didn't do one thing that it was created to do: keep the house smell free!It's in my basement now!,[]
A completely useless product!,[]
"I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.",[]
"The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.",[]
My husband and I love this diaper pail.,[]
It doesn't stink up the room with poopy diaper smell and it's very easy to work.,[]
Simply pull the handle and drop the piston down and Poof!,[]
no more stinky diaper :0)The only downside that we've found is that sometimes the diapers will build up underneath the piston part and get stuck.,[]
Then you have to open the pail up and pull them out.,[]
This is another great baby purchase.,[]
"When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a ""gadgety"" baby thing that we didn't need.",[]
"He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.",[]
"I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.",[]
"Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.",[]
"Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.",[]
Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!,[]
I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years.,[]
Easy to use and change.,[]
I love that it uses reg bags.,[]
:),[]
"After reading all the reveiws here, I bought the diaper champ thinking it was a great deal.",[]
I liked that I could use any type of bag with it and not have to hunt down the genie bags.,[]
It does inhibit the odor from escaping the pail however there is one major downfall with this item.,[]
Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.,[]
The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.,[]
"If you have nice nails and prefer to keep them, I suggest getting a different pail.",[]
I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I've been nothing but happy with it.,[]
I tried my sister's diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use.,[]
The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.,[]
I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don't have to go looking for them.,[]
"I've never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it's worth it!",[]
I had a daughter seven years earlier and her diaper pail was said to have 'no odor!',[]
Every company has to say that their product is the best.,[]
"Would you really buy a diaper pail if the box said something like, ""This diaper pail is almost odor free!!!""",[]
I sure wouldn't.,[]
"With this baby, the Diaper Champ was the best choice over all.",[]
No special bags to buy or anything.,[]
"As with any diaper recepticle, you have to clean the thing out often.",[]
"When babies get older, the poo get's stinkier.",[]
I never keep the diaper pail in the baby's room either.,[]
"Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?",[]
"For us, place the pail goes is either in the bathroom or in the garage.",[]
"Also, be prepared to stop using a diaper pail altogether when you have a toddler.",[]
"Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.",[]
You may get four or five in a good sized diaper pail before you begin to loose room.,[]
Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.,[]
"If you don't plan on having any more babies after the user of the pail out grows it, have a garage sale.",[]
Baby items are HUGE sellers and people will pay pretty well for them.,[]
"As for the rating of the diaper pail, I put four stars up there so that no one would pass over the review thinking that it's another bowl you over positive report.",[]
Ain't I a stinker?,[]
"We recently purchased the new model of Diaper Champ to replace our old one (which we loved, until it recently broke after several years of use.)",[]
"The new model STINKS, quite literally!",[]
"From the first diaper we put in (peed on, no poop) I could smell a foul odor any time I was near it.",[]
"I don't have a particularly strong sense of smell, and I don't believe my expectations are too high for it to contain the smell of wet diapers from a six-month-old -- but I am so disappointed I am considering trying to return it after a week of use.",[]
"(Gross, I know -- but I am hoping they would not re-sell it!)",[]
"Anyway, I can only assume either a change has been made to the new model that renders it ineffective or that we got a ""lemon.""",[]
"Our old Diaper Champ worked well for our daughter (now 4) from birth till potty-training, then worked well for our son for 6 months until, like several other reviewers, we accidentally broke it by pulling out some foam.",[]
But our new one is completely worthless!,[]
"At any rate, I would NOT recommend it to a new mom at this point, and will now investigate other options.",[]
"Update: didn't return it, but did get rid of it.",[]
We now put each diaper in a ziploc and take them out nightly with the kitchen trash.,[]
"It sounds like from the reviews that some people get ""good"" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.",[]
You decide: are you willing to spend the money if you are not sure which one you'll get (the one that works or the one that stinks)?,[]
The diaper champ was wonderful for the first 5 months of parenting.,[]
"Once my son started eating ""real"" food (and I am talking only baby veggies such as sweet potatoes, green beans, etc.)",[]
the diaper champ doesn't do a lick of good.,[]
"The smell permeates from the bin, throughout his room, and even into the hall!",[]
"We used to only change the bag twice a week, now we seem to change it twice a day!",[]
"The reason I give it three stars is because at least I don't have to buy expensive refills, I can just use cheap costco garbage bags.",[]
"Friends have said they found the same thing happen with the diaper genie, too.",[]
Guess the solution is to just put the diaper directly into the outdoor trash bin!,[]
We bought this item a little more than a year ago.,[]
"It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.",[]
I would not recommend it.,[]
"WE have our changing table in our living room, where the kids are most of the time, and the reek got so bad, that we ended up putting it outside, I am sure to never bring in again.",[]
"Contrary to other posters suggestions, we do change it about every other day, and the reek is so bad.",[]
"Even after spraying febreze, or glade neutralizer in it...",[]
"I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.",[]
Go with something else.,[]
"Like some of the other reviews, I too sprayed with Lysol and changed bags frequently but still got a very foul odor from the Diaper Champ within a couple of months.",[]
I purchased this after I got tired of changing and buying refills for my diaper genie and it was a blessing but the smell of this became unbearable.,[]
We have ours in our living room and you can't smell a thing.,[]
"It is a little difficult to open and it doesn't hold a lot of diapers, but overall it works well.",[]
I love this diaper disposal system.,[]
"It is simpler to use than others that I have tried, and it is odor-free.",[]
"The icing on the cake is that you can use ANY trash bag, you donthave to buy one of theirs.",[]
What I do is put a regular kitchen trash bag in the container.,[]
"When my son soils a diaper, I put that in an individual diaper disposal bag (Sassy makes some great ones that you can get at the drugstore, as does Especially For Baby that you can get at BRU.",[]
Both are baby powder scented).,[]
Then I put that in the Diaper Champ and VOILA!,[]
No odor whatsoever!,[]
It is simple and keeps the nursery smelling fresh.,[]
"I don't own this, but we were visiting some friends who have one in their kitchen and one in their daughter's room.",[]
"I went to nurse my son in their daughter's room, and couldn't because the smell from their Diaper Champ was so horrible.",[]
"It probably is fine if you clean it regularly, and when babies are breastfed exclusively (poop gets much smellier when they start solids or drink formula) but I am so glad we have the Diaper Dekor--no odors whatsoever.",[]
The diaper champ is definitely the best diaper pail out there.,[]
We first got the diaper genie but found it a bit complicated.,[]
After we got over that hump we had to keep buying the refills.,[]
We decided to buy the diaper champ instead and I think it is awesome.,[]
"It rarely smells (you just wipe it down with some disinfectant and your good to go), is convenient and easy to use and hello, no refills.",[]
I would definitely reccomend!,[]
"With our 1st child, we had a different diaper pail, which still used the regular garbage bags, but it had a fabric twist at the top that soaked up a lot of odors -- it was good, but it wasnt AS GOOD AS THE DIAPER CHAMP!",[]
I am so pleased I picked this diaper pail.,[]
"I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.",[]
I highly recommend this product!,[]
Being a first time mom I reviewed every diaper holder possible.,[]
"Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.",[]
Who wants to stick your hand in with a full diaper?,[]
This champ is so easy.,[]
Just drop in and turn.,[]
"Yes, it does fill in the center, but if you shake the pail you can get a few more diapers in.",[]
We use a scented bag and are changing more frequently now because my son has larger diapers.,[]
With newborns we could go a week.,[]
The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.,[]
There is no comparison- this is the best.,[]
"You can't put poopie diapers in this pail, it doesn't hold the smell back at all.",[]
I use it for the wet diapers and it's fine.,[]
I use the scented bags for the poopie diapers and throw them away in my regular garabage that gets taken out every day.,[]
"Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.",[]
The big blue round part on the side broke off for some reason and it wouldn't go back on.,[]
I ended up using masking tape to hold it on.,[]
"It serves it's purpose, but I'm not thrilled with it.",[]
Have had now for 10months and I love it.,[]
"I love the fact you are able to use regular trash bags and not have to buy any ""special"" bags.",[]
Smell is contained well.,[]
As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.,[]
We need to make sure to close the diaper back up befor we put it in the slot or the diaper would get caught in the chamber and we would have to open up the pail to get it out.,[]
Not that big of a deal.,[]
I love it.UPDATE November 1 2005I rate it 1 star on solid foodIt really stinks when kid has started solids.,[]
"I have tired bleaching it and leaving it in over night I have tried comet over night, and nothing gets out the wicked smell.",[]
It is awful and I have chaged it when the bag was not even half full.,[]
"I have tired leaving it out side for a week to air out, did not work.",[]
It did great for about a year but not so great anymore.,[]
This diaper pail is great and even better that you don't have to worry about running out of bags.,[]
You can use just regular trash bags which is awesome.,[]
"I have three complaints, the first is that you can only use about half the trash bag because of the way it dumps them in there which is kinda a waste.",[]
The second is that it doesn't twist shut like the genie does so when you open up the pail you smell all the lovely smells.,[]
The last is that it's top heavy when you open it up to put in the bag so you have to manuever it to put the bag in so it doesn't fall over but it can be done.,[]
That's the only time it smells though.,[]
My baby is breast fed so the smell isn't as bad as formula fed babies but our room smells fresh and clean.,[]
These minor details wouldn't make me change my mind.,[]
"I like not having to buy expensive bags especially with all the other costs a baby brings, and it does keep the smell out which is what it's supposed to do.",[]
I have had a great experience with this product so far and have been using it for about 2 months.,[]
"I get absolutely no odors in the tiny nursery (even when my daughter had very smelly diarrhea), it's easy to use and DOES NOT NEED ANY EXPENSIVE REFILL BAGS (just regular garbage bags) and I would recommend it to anyone.",[]
"My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple ""flip the handle"" approach.",[]
"You need to consider a couple of things before buying it, though.",[]
"First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little ""sausages""  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.",[]
"Second, there seems to be a foam seal around the chute mechanism, and if you aren't careful to wrap up the sticky ends of diapers they can catch and tear this, rendering the smell worse!",[]
"I haven't tried the Diaper Genie personally, but I think if I had it to do over, I might go with it and go out of my way to buy special bags just to eliminate the nasty diaper odor!",[]
The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!,[]
"Let's face it, you can smell the dirty diapers eventually no matter which one of these you buy, but this one has many bonus features.",[]
"For one, it uses standard garbage bags so you don't have to go out and buy special bags to fit it.",[]
"Not to mention it is easy to figure out, not just for us parents, but the Grandparents can use it easily too!",[]
"A friend of mine had twins and when she saw my Diaper Champ, she ran out and got one and LOVES it!",[]
She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!,[]
"When in doubt, go with the Diaper Champ...you won't be disappointed!!!",[]
!,[]
"I have three children, and have had experience with several types of diaper pails over the years.",[]
This diaper pail is by far the best and easiest I have ever used.,[]
It uses your own kitchen can liners and doesn't leak oder at all.,[]
Its one handed disposal design makes it easy for a busy mom to use!,[]
I really wish I had this diaper pail when my first child was born 8 years ago!,[]
I LOVE this diaper pail.,[]
"We have the Odor-Less pail for our older child, and it was great until she learned how to open it herself.",[]
The Diaper Champ is both sturdier and cooler the way that it disposes of the diaper.,[]
It is a cinch to put in new trash bags too.,[]
I keep a bunch in the bottom for easy re-bagging.,[]
"I just love that I can use regular trash bags and if I'm concerned about smells, then I'll throw a car air freshner in it....but it doesn't leak odor, so I probably won't have to.",[]
"I'm just thoroughly impressed, and I love that my sneaky toddler can't open it.",[]
Definitely a must have for new parents!!,[]
!,[]
"When I was pregnant with my son, I thought that I would be saving money by buying this.",[]
"When my son was a infant, it worked okay.",[]
"Around five months, when he started eating solid foods, it started to smell.",[]
"I tried to bleach it, I tryed Lysol and I tryed all the scented trash bags.",[]
Nothing helped.,[]
The smell only got worse.,[]
It got to the point that the whole room would smell like a diaper pail.,[]
I could never get the smell out.,[]
I finally bought the diaper genie and I love it.,[]
I have two kids and I use it alot.,[]
I change the refill only once a month and it doesn't smell at all.,[]
I have used this product for 21 months and up till 1 month ago it worked great.,[]
"Recently the odor seal seems to have failed.I saw in a different post where they got baby trend to send them a new seal, so I will try that, but even if I buy a whole new pail I feel that I got my money's worth out of this one.",[]
20 months of refills for the Diaper Genie would have cost me $100-$200(or more??),[]
and been yet another thing to remember to get at the store.I have used standard kitches bags and had no problem with odor until the seal broke.,[]
"The unit was hard to open to change bags the first month or so, but got easier as it got older, but still not easy enough for my 21 month old to open like reports I read for the Diaper Dekor.",[]
"Switching bags take 2 seconds and since they are regular kitchen bags they hold alot if needed, but can be changed often without wasting money.",[]
For best results roll the diaper and use the velcro to make it a ball before popping it through.,[]
Now doing size 5 diapers without a problem fitting them in.,[]
"They only time there was any odor before the seal broke was during bag changing, and then it was just the time it took to grab the bag out and tie a knot in the top.We are about to have a second child and I am going to get a new one of these units for her room  and hopefully get a new seal for my current one.Even though it is broken now, I still give it 5 stars for how much abuse it took for 20 months.","[('bag', 0.13157069965345725)]"
A bargain compared to the competiton.,[]
We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child...and what a Godsend!,[]
"It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy  refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?",[]
"It also holds a lot more diapers....look at the size of it!Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.",[]
I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!),[]
when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!,[]
I highly recommend this!,[]
This pail is great.,[]
We only empty it twice  week.,[]
We never smell it ant the bags cost pennies.,[]
Its easy to use and easy to empty.,[]
Highly recommended.,[]
this is far superior to the genie.,[]
"No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?",[]
So this one is much better - when you open the genie you get the smell of the previous diaper but not with the champ because there is nothing to open - just flip the lid!,[]
Much better - I have both and wish I had known about this one before I got the genie.,[]
The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.,[]
"I remember reading a good review about the Diaper Champ and deciding to get it.Honestly, it does a great job.",[]
It does contain the odor to inside the Champ.,[]
"I have never noticed a smell in the room, even when it is full.",[]
"I have to admit, however, that when you open that bad boy up to empty it, it's pretty funky, but what do you expect?If you wrap up your diapers good and empty it before it gets so full that you can't squeeze another diaper into it, you will really be happy.",[]
It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.,[]
"We use the scented bags, which we think helps a lot.Overall, we are very pleased with the Diaper Champ and would recommend it highly!",[]
"(Only reason I rated it 4out of 5 stars is - nothing's perfect, I have a hard time giving out 5 to anything!)",[]
The diaper champ is very easy to use and relatively easy to change the bags (which are regular kitchen garbage bags ...,[]
nice!,[]
"), but my son's room stinks because it doesn't really get rid of any of the odor.",[]
I'm going to try something else ...,[]
We love that you can use any plastic bag for this diaper pail.,[]
"The overall design is good, and easy to use.The few minor issues we have had is with the latch to open/close the pail, and a few construction issues.1.",[]
"Latch: The unit can be hard to open with the inter-locking ""layers"" (Lid, Bag holder, Base)2.",[]
"Construction: A) The sliding plunger can get stuck on an inner seam of the top, it can be pushed into alignment but can be aggravating at 3am.B) The ""foam"" pad that the rotating section rides on can become seperated from the plastic housing and the adhesive sticks to the rotating barrel making the top stick.Overall we like the Diaper Champ, but wouldn't mind seeing a couple design improvements.",[]
This was a very poor purchase I was sucked in with the no refills to buy but the smell is horrible I have to empty it almost everyday and even after that it sits out on my porch half the time to get the smell out and even then it still stinks.,[]
If I had to do over again I would buy another Diaper Genie.,[]
This is a great product until your little one starts to play with the handle.,[]
"Because the flip-flop handle comes in contact with the dirty diapers when the bag gets full, curious fingers can pick up some nasty germs &amp; even poop if a diaper isn't wrapped up into itself (The Grandmas seem to have trouble with that).I have been very happy with the simplicity of the Champ &amp; using regular garbage bags until now.","[('champ', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"However, my 14 month old loves to play with it &amp; flip the handle over.",[]
"I just cringe when I think about what he gets on his hands.Also, the padding in the lid that keeps odor under control seems to have worn out after 1 year.",[]
"It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.",[]
"YUCK!Overall, I would recommend the Champ for infants because it's VERY easy &amp; you can use 1 hand, but now that I have a toddler I'm looking for a pail with a locking lid.",[]
I love my Diaper Champ.,[]
"It is easy to use, seals odors, and my son (and dogs) cannot get into it.",[]
I bought the diaper champ to ensure my dogs could not get to the diaper pail contents and they have not even gone near it because it does not smell or anything!,[]
"Granted, any pail that you put poopie diapers in is going to smell.",[]
"For that reason, we put the poopies directly into the trash can since it is emptied quicker.",[]
"My sone is 8.5 months old, eating solids 3 times a day, and I have never smelled anything coming from this pail.",[]
It will be the gift I buy for all my friends having babies!,[]
The Diaper Champ is wonderful!,[]
"It's great because you don't have to by any special kind of garbage bag, and it does a good job of containing the smell of stinky diapers.",[]
We are 1st time parents &amp; I read all the reviews on diaper-disposal products.,[]
Now our baby is 1 month old &amp; I've never smelled a poopy diaper (and we formula feed) in our nursery which is in our master bedroom.,[]
We are both clean-addicts &amp; love this product.,[]
(NO EXPENSIVE REFILLS NEEDED!!!),[]
We empty it twice per week &amp; have NO ODOR problems!Update at 7mos(July04): We managed to get BabiesRUs to let us exchange the DiaperChamp for a DiaperGenie and we were equally dissapointed with it too.,[]
DiaperChamp was great until about 3 mos.,[]
&amp; then just smelled all the time.,[]
Diaper Genie was no better - even with toddler-strength refills.,[]
I have found it so much easier to use cheap ziplocks and throw diapers in regular trash that goes out each night anyway (both Diaper keepers required emptying every day &amp; would still smell).,[]
"I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.",[]
Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.,[]
Dissapointing - wish it worked!,[]
I agree with the other reviews.,[]
This pail is the one to get.,[]
We were given the Fisher Price Odor Free Diaper Pail and it was horrible.,[]
It still stinks even empty.,[]
We've been using the Diaper Champ for over a week now and I don't have any complaints.,[]
"It holds more diapers, is easy to use and doesn't smell.",[]
What more can you ask for?,[]
"It's bigger and kind of odd looking, but who cares?",[]
My son is now 5 mo.,[]
"and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.",[]
I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.,[]
Do not kid yourself that you will have an odor-free diaper pail--I do not think that is possible!,[]
I would rate this as low-odor--I change the bag about once a week.,[]
"My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed.",[]
"Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing.",[]
"I do not wrap up the messy ones because of the leak factor, so I wind up having to open the lid frequently.",[]
"The lid is a bit difficult to open, but I like that because when my little guy is more mobile he won't be able to open it!",[]
"Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.",[]
"It works easily with one hand, which is important.",[]
"Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.",[]
"While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.",[]
My son is 17 months old now and the thing with diaper pails is that the dumptser outside will always be the best place for those solid-food-eating stinky diapers.,[]
"We've had this one from the beginning, and it's good enough for wet diapers, but we don't dare put stinky diapers in there.",[]
"Even with only putting wet diapers in, when we change out the bag, we let the pail sit outside, opened up and sprayed with lysol overnight before putting a new bag in and putting it back in the house.",[]
"I just don't know that you can really expect ""odor-free"" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.",[]
"I'm sure the smell factor will worsen now, so, trying to decide with another baby on the way if we'll buy yet another one of these or go with a different pail that requires expensive bags--??",[]
?,[]
I think it's great...I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!,[]
It definitely keeps the smell out.,[]
The diaper champ is fantastic.,[]
You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.,[]
There is absolutely no dirty diaper smell that comes from the Diaper Champ.Absolutely recommend this product.,[]
I love the Diaper Champ for the simple fact that there is absolutely NO SMELL AT ALL in the room I have this thing in!,[]
I love that I don't have squish the diaper down and turn the tight wheel like on the Genie (I hated that thing).,[]
I also love that I can use regular garbage bags rather than buy any special bags that I have to read instructions to insert.This thing is self-explanatory when you take it out of the box.,[]
"If you can't flip it to put another diaper in there, you gotta empty it!",[]
....and that is that!!,[]
!,[]
The Diaper Champ is very easy to use.,[]
"Changing the bags is as easy as can be, and you operate it easily with one hand (keeping the other on the baby).",[]
I appreciate that I don't have to buy special bags for it.,[]
"However, it does not control the oder.",[]
I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.,[]
"If you think your 3 month old's diaper stink, you ain't smelled nothing yet.",[]
I love this pail.,[]
"You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid.",[]
Sooooo simple.,[]
"It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.",[]
"With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean.",[]
(It also needs special cartridges).,[]
"With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second!",[]
It holds more diapers too.,[]
I definitely recommend it.,[]
I have a 2 year old; I stopped using the diaper champ when he turned about 1.,[]
The smell was awful.,[]
I tried leaving an air fresher in the pail but it still did not help.,[]
I even called the Baby Trend (they where extremely helpful) about a gasket replacement since mine tore and smelled.,[]
And that did not help.,[]
We finally just gave up on it.,[]
"I am the kind of person who strives for perfection, so when I began registering for baby items I took the extra step and researched and read reviews for almost everything.",[]
I decided to register for the Diaper Champ (based on reviews).,[]
The Diaper Champ is definitely worth having.,[]
There are no bags to buy and there is no smell!,[]
I keep the Diaper Champ in my bedroom next to the Pack 'N Play and visitors don't even realize that they are standing next to dirty diapers.,[]
Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.,[]
It is a little difficult to open - ladies careful with your fingernails!,[]
"I was given the Diaper Geni and after a week of twisting, we bought the Diaper Champ.",[]
This was a great choice.,[]
There is no need to spend extra money on special bags.,[]
We use ordinary supermarket bags.,[]
"In order to keep the smell under control, we sprinkle baking soda right at the bottom of the chamber.",[]
"I got this pail because I felt it was good that it doesn't require you to buy ""their"" garbage bags.",[]
But at the end I still didn't use it and just use a regular pail.,[]
Now it's sitting in my basement.,[]
The reason I didn't use it is because it is hard to open up the can to replace the bag and when you are actually cleaning a baby especially when it's #2 it is messy at times where you would probably get it in the pail before you flip the handle to dispose of it.,[]
Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.,[]
You don't need more work with a child.,[]
"Someone told me not to get the Diaper Genie, but invest my money in the Champ.",[]
"What sold me on it is that the Champ uses ordinary garbage bags, nothing proprietary.",[]
"As my baby gets older and the poops get stinkier, we do have some odor problems, but we tend to cram the diaper bags as full as possible.",[]
"If we changed it every couple of days, there would probably not be an issue.",[]
"When we smell something, we change the bag; problem solved.",[]
"My only *real* problem with it is that, now that my son is walking, he likes to put things into the hole and turn the handle to watch them disappear.",[]
I keep waiting for the day when he throws away something important and I don't catch it!,[]
"I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!",[]
"I much prefer the champ - wonder which will be better with the odors later as things get bigger, but for now the champ's the one!",[]
Worst diaper pale ever!!,[]
I've had mine for 2 years now and I am throwing it away as soon as my second Decor arrives.,[]
"No matter how many times I clean the ""Chump"" it still stinks.",[]
The diapers and wipes get caught in the drop hole and stuck wet wipes make it stink even worse.,[]
"Forget scented trash bags, they won't cure the smell of the ""Chump"".",[]
"Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it.",[]
Forget this pale and go for the Decor.,[]
"This is a great diaper garbage can, but it still stinks.",[]
I don't think there is a diaper pail available that doesn't stink.,[]
I tried a stick on air freshener which then caused a stinky lemon smell.,[]
I have found that the best way to keep the smell away is to spray the inside with antibacterial spray every time you change the liner.,[]
This makes a big difference!,[]
I love the convenient one hand toss system.,[]
This is my 5th baby and the diaper champ is the easiest and least smelly system I've tried.,[]
"I bought this item because like many of you, I thought I would be saving money by not having to buy special bags for my diaper pail.",[]
"For the first 4 and half months that I have used the Diaper Champ, it has been pretty good.",[]
I probably would have given it about 3 or 4 stars.,[]
"It is very easy to use, and doesn't get too messy if you wrap your diaper up really well.",[]
"Some diapers are just unavoidably messy though and impossible to completely contain, in which case I would have to open the lid of the DC and throw in the messy diaper.",[]
"This is no easy feat, especially when trying to manage a wiggly baby and a messy diaper.",[]
"The lid doesn't always stay open too well on its own and so I would have to let the messy diaper sit out, put my baby in a place safe, then wrangle with the often difficult lid contraption!",[]
"Okay, not too much for me to deal with since it was saving me money.",[]
"I would only smell it occasionally if I were sitting on the floor near it, playing with my son.",[]
I breastfeed so the diapers aren't too stinky anyway.,[]
"Okay, now my son has begun solids and, my goodness, the stink that his poop has now taken on.",[]
The DC is now completely useless.,[]
Even one diaper makes it stink up the room-actually the entire upstairs!!,[]
I am not about to change the bag every time he poops.,[]
"I have sprayed lysol in it after every diaper change, dumped baking soda in it between diaper changes, nothing works!",[]
"Also, cleaning it out is a bit of a pain!",[]
"Since the lid doesn't detach, it is quite cumbersome.",[]
I actually have tried to figure out why it smells so bad and have realized that there is a gap where the handle is and you can actually see right into where the diapers are!,[]
Not a good product as far as I'm concerned.Currently shopping for a new diaper pail system and completely unsatisfied.,[]
"I received a used Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie, and I have put the Genie where it belongs, the trash!",[]
I even went out and bought a second Champ to have one on each floor of our house.,[]
"The Champ takes regular trash bags and unlike other reviewers, I haven't had ANY problems with the smell, and change the bags myself with ease.",[]
"The base is wide and sturdy, and diapers are easily thrown away with one hand.",[]
It's perfect to be able to throw away the diaper and keep one hand on the baby.,[]
I will buy one for all of my friends who have a baby!,[]
We got ours two years ago.,[]
(Yes a little late to write a review.),[]
I had the diaper genie and it was such a hassle.,[]
You had to remember to buy refills and you had to use this blade thingy to cut the bags when you changed the pail.,[]
Oh what a relief the Champ was.,[]
First it uses regular garbage bags.,[]
Right there is a huge savings!,[]
I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!,[]
(Every refill for the genie is 4.99+ and you need 1.5 a month min.),[]
I learned that you need to change the bags more often (3-4x a week) as they grow older.,[]
There was a short time that I changed it once a day and that kept the smell away totally.,[]
I was able to clean the pail (in the bathtub) with standard cleaners very easily.,[]
I guess with scented bags the pail could be changed less often.,[]
(I never tried that.),[]
"The one problem that I had/have is now that my child is older (3.5) he has started to pour water and throw all sorts of things into the pail, but they do that with anything thats not locked up.",[]
"Imagine, if they started to play with the genie in the same way, it has a blade right at the top!",[]
Yow!,[]
Yes I know that its pretty protected but these kids can get into anything thats not locked down 100 percent.,[]
(And sometimes in that too.),[]
So I give this diaper pail a whopping thumbs up!Good luck to all new mothers!,[]
It's great.,[]
"As easy to use as a trash can, but without the odor!",[]
I'm thrilled with my Diaper Champ.,[]
My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad.,[]
She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ.,[]
Boy am I glad!,[]
It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!!,[]
My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!!,[]
I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox.,[]
You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it.,[]
"The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail.",[]
I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!,[]
!,[]
"I bought this diaper pail because you can use any bag, no refills.",[]
It holds alot of diapers with no smell.,[]
You will not be disappointed with this diaper pail.,[]
Much easier to use than the Diaper Genie.,[]
"I ended up throwing away my Diaper Genie after only 8 month because the blade broke that cuts the bags, and it was too hard to use.",[]
"The new bags that I bought for it weren't working right, and I couldn't do it with one hand.",[]
"My sister-in-law had this Diaper Champ, and it was so much easier, and more economical since you don't have the special bags to use.",[]
We looked into several different diaper pails before deciding to register and use the diaper champ for our twins 6 months ago.,[]
we have been VERY HAPPY with this item.,[]
We have one on each floor of the house for use at diaper changing times.,[]
"The best part is no, no special bags or bag units to buy--just use a regular garbage bag to line the pail.",[]
You never really worry about not having the correct bags available!,[]
!,[]
"Diapers are expensive enough, so we didn't want to have to keep buying diaper pail inserts also.",[]
The Diaper Champ has worked well for us.,[]
When our daughter was infant there was NO smell.,[]
It was just awesome.,[]
As our daughter has grown bigger (and her poo smellier) we've had to take a few extra measures to keep the Champ in good shape.,[]
"Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.",[]
And any particularly icky ones go straight to the outside trash.,[]
And I take it outside to air out every 2-3 weeks.,[]
"But overall, its been great.",[]
I would recommend it highly.,[]
This is my second child.,[]
"With my first, I went through the Diaper Genie and hated it ---her nursery always smelled, even though my husband regularly changed that annoying (and expensive refill, $5.00 for each refill adds up faster than you think!)",[]
"diaper system, he even took it outside and hosed it down with Clorox bleach and sprayed it regularly with Lysol -- to no avail.We also tried the Neat Diaper disposal system, and it's pretty and works a little better than the Genie, but it still smells up the room.",[]
"The Diaper Champ wins hands down, I for one never had an odor problem and I love the fact that it's easy to use and easy to empty, it's also easy to dispose of the diaper with one hand (especially when you're holding and infant and don't want to leave a smelly diaper out of the pail), something I couldn't do with neither the Genie not the Neat pail.I highly recommend it!","[('diaper', 0.15395827110791832)]"
My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.,[]
"As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.",[]
"She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.","[('huggies', 0.06097556761734289)]"
"Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that.As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the ""plunger"" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.","[('inspection', 0.05516766515132153)]"
"But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.",[]
I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.,[]
It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.,[]
Go for the Champ.,[]
It lives up to its name.,[]
"For the first few months I thought this product was great, but I was wrong.",[]
Man does it STINK!,[]
"Lysol, bleach, air out- nothing helps!",[]
It is a waste of 20 bucks.,[]
Trust me- DO NOT BUY IT!,[]
"I even called the company thinking mine must be broken, but as seen by these reviews- IT JUST STINKS!",[]
I had one of those dreaded Diaper Geenies when my 11-year old was an infant.,[]
I couldn't even burden anybody by giving it away and just tossed the thing in the trash.,[]
Before my now 6-month old was born I read the reviews about the Diaper Champ and just had to try it.,[]
It used to take me 5 agonizing minutes to change the Geenie and when I was done my entire house smelled like an outhouse.,[]
I can tie off the regular trash bag used in the Champ while holding my breath.,[]
"When I change the bag I spray the new bag full of air-odor neutralizer, snap the Champ shut and use it (only for poopy diapers) for up to three weeks without changing it!",[]
"I know that sounds absolutely disgusting, but the thing retains odor so well that we just forget about it, except once a day when I'm stuffing a poopy diaper into it, even then I just see it and not smell it.",[]
(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.),[]
If this thing smells for you then you need take it back and exchange it for a new one.,[]
It's absolutely awesome!,[]
This item is great!,[]
"No twisting, buying expensive bags, and it holds a great deal more!!!!",[]
"I don't understand the hype regarding the Genie... the Champ is far better in every aspect- it's affordable, easy to use, uses standard kitchen bags, holds more diapers than I care to admit!",[]
Everytime I use this system I have to use my hand to force the diaper in the pail.,[]
Also the seal broke and the smell is aweful!!!!!,[]
"The seal was broke wihtin the first month and now I am looking to find a new diaper dispisal....this product is no champ, it gets a KO (knock out) not an OK from me!",[]
We had read and heard plenty of awful reviews about the Diaper Genie so we originally purchased the Neat diaper disposal system.,[]
It was a pain to put together and then it didn't work at all!,[]
When I went back to the store to return it I asked the sales person what the best diaper disposal was and she recommended the Diaper Champ and said it was their most popular.I love it!,[]
It was easy to put together and is very easy to use.,[]
It uses regular trash bags which saves time and money.,[]
We have not had a problem with odor but since we have twins we do have to change the bag pretty frequently.,[]
I have since bought a second Diaper Champ so we now have one in the nursery and one at the changing station in our family room.This is the best system I have used!,[]
ABSOLUTELY NO ODORS!!,[]
"I have a beagle who completely ignores the diaper champ, will eat out of every other garbage can in the house, but ignores the champ.",[]
"a bit of a struggle as diapers get bigger, but totally worth the money!!!",[]
"also, a bit of a pain to clean...either outside with the hose or in the tub.",[]
No refills and odor free..can't beat that!,[]
!,[]
I purchased this diaper champ before my second child was born.,[]
"I too have noticed that it does smell the room up, however not as bad  as knock-off brands.",[]
It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.,[]
I have noticed that if the diaper isn't secured into a ball that the tabs SOMETIMES get caught up at the bottom and block the flow of future diapers.,[]
"However, this is often my fault and easily fixed.",[]
Love the diaper champ b/c i can use ANY bags...,[]
I also had heard the rave reviews about the Diaper Champ versus the Genie.,[]
So I got two Champs with the birth of my daughter.,[]
"When we had to begin shutting the nursery door after our cat was jumping in the crib, the diaper smell upon opening the door was almost unbearable.",[]
"Yes, I do change it 2x per week and wipe it completely down but I still notice the smell.",[]
I was sold on the usage of regular garbage bags with it but I realize that may be part of the problem.,[]
There is nothing sealing the smells in.,[]
"The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.",[]
"If the tabs of the diaper are not securely wrapped around the diaper they will get stuck in the tube and you have to open it up, thus releasing the stench.",[]
"Friends have said they don't go through the Genie refills as quickly as I had feared, which was one of my reservations about it.",[]
"If I had to do it again, I would probably go with the Genie.",[]
I love the diaper champ!,[]
It's super easy to change.,[]
I have two!,[]
And you don't have to purchase any special bags.,[]
What more could you possibly want from this item.,[]
And the price is great also!,[]
The Diaper Champ is easy to use and I like the fact that you can use any type of bags.,[]
But the whole room stinks.,[]
Our daughter is only 8 weeks so I am sure the smell will get worse.,[]
So we are going to give the Diaper Dekor a try.,[]
"This is great overall, but it doesn't quite get five stars from me.",[]
"It's easy to use, and I appreciate being able to use regular garbage bags.",[]
"However, it can be slightly difficult to open the unit for changing bags.Definitely agree with the people who mentioned that anything that is plastic is bound to pick up smells.",[]
"We barely notice any smells from this--we end up sprinkling lightly-scented baking soda into each diaper bag and have an air freshener in the bottom of the apparatus, and have been extremely satisfied.",[]
I have researched all the diaper pails out there.,[]
For my first 2 children I used Diaper Genie which by the second child was so rancid it was thrown out.,[]
"Of course, that was over 6 years ago.",[]
I then resorted to Ziploc bags near the changing area.,[]
"Works wonders, NO smell, whether breast or bottle feeding.",[]
The annoying part is having to walk out to the kithen afterwards to throw it away.,[]
This Diaper Champ will be a wonderful addition to a nursery as I can still use Ziploc bags but then have a double barrier by throwing the Ziploced diaper bags into this diaper pail.,[]
My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.,[]
"I still recommend for any diaper pail to use Ziploc bags as an extra barrier of ""smell protection"".",[]
I will have used the Ziploc method thru 3 of my soon to be 4 children and I would never do it any other way.,[]
"The nice feature about this diaper pail is that you don't have to spend extra money on refills, any it is only a fraction of the cost to buy a box of Zipoc bags.",[]
"My son is 6 months old, and we used the Diaper Champ from his birth.",[]
"It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.",[]
"It's also spacious, so you don't need to change the plastic bags often.",[]
"But the greatest advantage is that you can use your own bags, and not waste money on the refills (which are pretty costly and useless in my opinion).",[]
The Diaper Champ saves us from wrapping individual dirty diapers in plastic bags to prevent smelling up the room.,[]
When we went shopping for diapers pails the only one I was familiar with was the Genie and I didn't want the hassle of having to buy special bags.,[]
We found the Diaper Champ and we love it!,[]
Our son is 2 months old and we have no complaints with it.,[]
There is never a smell and is so easy to empty.,[]
I will buy this as a shower gift for anyone I know that is going to have baby!,[]
This one is the best and a must have!,[]
Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.,[]
The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.,[]
It's a trash can so it should be simple.,[]
I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!,[]
"This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!",[]
Why spend money on special trash bags?,[]
I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.,[]
They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes.,[]
"The Diperchamp is easy to use, as other people have said.",[]
"We bought it with our first child, but stopped using it before she turned one.",[]
It does not keep the smell in and with only one stinky diper in there my daughter's entire room would smell the moment you walked in.I really loved the diperchamp when she was a newborn and her dipers did not smell.,[]
Now that we are pregnant with our second child I am not planning on using it again because we did not use it for very long.,[]
I like BabyTrend's products.,[]
"We also have a SnapNGo, and we also seriously considered the Trend High Chair.",[]
We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born.,[]
I think it does what it advertises and that is that it does a good job of keeping in the odors (we live in a 1 bedroom condo).,[]
"Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean.",[]
"Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.",[]
"Hint: If using spray cleaning, don't spray water into the drop-in hole.",[]
The mechanism is not completely watertight and you'll trap some water in there.,[]
"Myself, I've actually done a thorough cleaning only twice.",[]
Most times I just spray Lysol inside after changing to a new plastic bag.,[]
I absolutely thought that this item was a great invention until I tried it....twice.,[]
It does not even come close to keeping the odor in and was a huge waste of time to even try.,[]
The first one that I bought broke after only 2 weeks of use.,[]
So I then exchanged it for the same item only to find out that it still is a bad product all together.,[]
The thought of not having to buy refill bags was a big turn on but now I will go buy the Genie instead.,[]
We bought this to replace the Diaper Dekor Plus based on the recommendation of friends and a woman who has watched babies for 13 years.,[]
We put Glad Triple Lined bags in it and never smell a thing!,[]
I bought this when my son was born because it was recommended by a friend.,[]
I liked it at the beginning because it was easy to put the diapers in and you can use a regular trash bag.,[]
"Well, we've had it for awhile and it always smells like poop and its supposed to be odor free.",[]
We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.,[]
Do not recommend it at all.,[]
"My daughter is almost nine months old, and my husband and I have generally been very happy with the Diaper Champ.",[]
It is definitely much more cost-effective than the Diaper Genie or any other contraption that requires special bags and cartridges.,[]
It's easy to use and easy to clean and looks fairly discreet in the corner of our nursery.,[]
"I am much shorter than my husband and we both find the handle to be at a good height, so we don't have any trouble reaching it as we're changing our daughter.Small Complaints:1.",[]
"As other reviewers have noted, as my daughter has switched from breastmilk to solid food (a transition which happen to coincide with a hot and muggy summer), the Champ has become much stinkier.",[]
"The problem can be temporarily rectified with a really thorough cleaning, but the overall ability of the Champ to confine the smell is definitely less than ideal.2.",[]
"It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!",[]
I would definitely recommend.,[]
I had two Diaper Genies at home and hated having to squish the diaper down into the pail.,[]
I used the Diaper Champ in the Mom's room at Babies R Us and immediately fell in love with it!,[]
The Diaper Genies were replaced with a Diaper Champ and I couldn't be happier!!,[]
"No more nasty smell when opening the lid of the Diaper Genie, no more squishing dirty diapers into flimsy film - just put the rolled diaper in the hole on the top of the Diaper Champ, flip the handle and the diaper is gone!I would definately recommend this diaper pail to anyone before the Diaper Genie!","[('diaper', 0.16821720785551597)]"
"I had heard all the horror stories about the Diaper Genie (difficult to use, expensive...), so when getting ready for our first child I decided on the Diaper Champ.",[]
This product has been wonderful!,[]
"!The changing station that we use most is in our master bedroom, so that is where we have the Diaper Champ.",[]
I have not had any problems being able to smell dirty diapers except when you open it up to change the bag.,[]
"I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!","[('daughter', 0.10549480957565062)]"
This is a definite savings factor.I would personally recommend the Diaper Champ to anyone in the market.,[]
I mean if the pail actually stinks do you think I would keep it in my bedroom?,[]
!,[]
"I hate to say it, but the improvements made to this product actually made it WORSE!",[]
"The original was wonderful -- lasted forever, worked great, ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL... the only bad thing was the mechanism to open it was difficult.",[]
We had the original for over a year with no smell at all.,[]
Then we decided to get the upgraded and improved one and were SO disappointed!,[]
It started to smell almost immediately and only got worse.,[]
"I'm sorry to say, we should have stuck to the original.",[]
Maybe the company will hear enough complaints to go back to the old one!,[]
"In the mean time, we're looking for a different product.",[]
My sister purchased the Diaper Champ from my registery.,[]
It is wonderful because you never have to buy special bags adding extra cost.,[]
It is easy to use and empty.,[]
"There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.",[]
"However, it keeps the room and you home from smelling bad and you can take the bag straight out to the trash cans.",[]
It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.,[]
If you are a new mom or just in the market for a place to dispose of dirty diapers do not get this product.,[]
It does not contain the smell even after changing the bag daily.,[]
I hear the older models are much better.,[]
There is no tight seal and the smell just leaks out.,[]
Not worth the money.,[]
I stopped using this product after about 2 months.,[]
I now just tie up the diaper and put it in the trash!Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,[]
!,[]
I'm really happy with this diaper pale.,[]
It's so easy to use and I love that you can use regular garbage bags.,[]
It's so convient and saves money instead of buying the refills like the other diaper pales out there.,[]
Also it is really easy to clean to!,[]
!,[]
"We love our diaper champe, it has been a god send to us.",[]
"No smell, no special bags, simple!!",[]
I think this is a MUST HAVE for everyone with a diapered child around.,[]
"After reading many of the reviews for this and the diaper Genie, I decided on the Diaper Champ.",[]
I am very pleased with it.,[]
"One, it is cost efficient in that you don't have to buy special bags.",[]
I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.,[]
"The unit is large enough thatI can store two or three extra bags in the bottom so when changing the dirty bag, i dont have to run to get a new one.",[]
i have not experienced any problems with odors.,[]
i change the bag every two or three days and have yet to be offended by the smell.,[]
"Once a week, I spray the unit with Lysol.",[]
"For the money, it is well worth it.",[]
I have also bought this for two subsequent baby showers and have heard no complaints.,[]
"THIS IS A GREAT GIFT THAT ANY NEW MOTHER WOULD LOVE; NO BUYING  SPECIAL TRASH BAGS, SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN A CORNER AND BEST OF ALL NO SMELLING UP THE HOUSE.",[]
MY HUSBAND WHO IS NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF CHANGING SOILED DIAPERS DOESN'T COMPLAIN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW TO USE THIS BABY ITEM.,[]
I used the Diaper Champ until my daughter was about 15 months old.,[]
"When she was about 1 and her diapers got really smelly, it just couldn't contain the odor any longer.",[]
"I tried spraying with Lysol, bleaching it, soaking it, putting baking soda in it, air fresheners, leaving it outside overnight...nothing got the smell out.",[]
I switched to the Diaper Genie with the toddler refills.,[]
"I really liked the Champ for the first 15 mos., though.",[]
"Easy to empty, use your own bags, etc.One small drawback is the loud ""thunk"" it makes when you drop the diaper into the well and flip it over.",[]
Could potentially wake a light sleeper.,[]
"I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.",[]
You are better off just getting a garbage pail with a tight lid.,[]
"Not only did my daughter's room smell horrible, but I broke three finger nails trying to lift the lid.",[]
"This is not a champ, it stinks.",[]
"It might work for 6mo old babies, but once the real dirty diapers come (our son is 21 months), this will not work.",[]
This product does not work for the following reasons:1.,[]
"You must tightly wrap the diaper around itself because it will a)not fit in the hole or b)if any of the soiled area of the diaper is exposed, it will soil the chamber walls.2.",[]
It is hard to wrap the diaper well when you have the other hand holding up your babies legs.3.,[]
"One you successfully get rid of the diaper, what about the wipes?",[]
"Heavily soiled wipes could also brush up against the chamber soiling the walls of the chamber, and the cartridge that falls to push the diaper down into the bag.4.",[]
You have to clean the Champ often as our son will often play with it.,[]
The chance of him touching fecal matter is great without constant cleaning.5.,[]
"The storage area of the Diaper Champ soon becomes very, very smelly.",[]
"Because the diapers are sitting in the open bag, the smell soon becomes absorbed into the plastic.",[]
No cleaning will remove the smell.6.,[]
"You will be able to smell the soiled diaper even with the Diaper Champ ""sealed"".",[]
You will probably smell the diaper within the hour.Our first diaper pail was the Diaper Genie.,[]
"It worked fine, however, the plastic did (after 20 months) absorb the bad smells, and after repeated attempts to clean it, we thought we would try the Diaper Champ.",[]
It was a bad decision.We prefer the Genie since the smell is contained better with the twisting mechanism.,[]
"The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.","[('genie', 0.06815242300922283)]"
"I assumed I would buy the Diaper Genie when purchasing a diaper pail, but was discouraged with buying refills weekly and after looking at it, even working the contraption.",[]
"So when I found the Champ, I was excited but unsure if it would really do the job.",[]
"Well, it has lived up to its name and has been a blessing since the day we brought our baby home.",[]
The Champ is so easy to use and empty.,[]
"The quick drop and flip makes diapers seem to disapear forever{WELL ALMOST :) A few odors do escape when empting the Diaper Champ, but are gone the second you tie the trash bag up and those few seconds of odor are well worth avoiding the hassel and hidden cost of the Genie.","[('flip', 0.0827748537602753)]"
I love it and I am so glad I read the reviews before I purchased!,[]
My girlfriend recommended the diaper champ over the diaper genie so I put it on my registry.,[]
It certainly seems to contain the odors.,[]
It's great that it uses regular garbage bags - no expensive refill bags to purchase.,[]
The only small problem I've noticed is that it stops working before the pail is full because it stacks the diapers through a narrow hole.,[]
"Also, when it's time to change the bag, wear a nose plug.",[]
This is the most awesome diaper system.,[]
"It is so easy and its nice to not have to buy re-fills, it just takes regular tall kitchen bags.",[]
I have not had an oder problem at all!,[]
This product came highly recommended and I am so glad we got this diaper pail....would buy it over and over!,[]
I used diaper champ for past 3 yrs for my first kid.,[]
"Poo Poo diapers when not put in the lid properly, gets the DC's lid soiled.",[]
Its so unhygenic to touch all that and clean it.,[]
"And its difficult to clean the crevices of the lid.So, most of the times, we open the DC and put the Poo soiled diapers.",[]
It also does not contain odor.,[]
"Always had it in the bathroom.I gave it 2 stars, because this one is ok for the non-stool diapers and is economical.",[]
"Now that Im expecting another one, Im reasearching to buy something else.",[]
Diaper Champ works well for me.,[]
It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.,[]
I use tall kitchen trash bags.,[]
I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.,[]
"I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.",[]
"We bought the Diaper Champ because you could use regular trash bags with it, which is a great feature.",[]
"At first we had no problem with smells; however, now that our daughter is six months old and eating solid foods, the smells have become an issue (and I do change the bag every 3 days and wrap the diapers up with the tabs) and are not contained with the Diaper Champ.","[('tabs', 0.096633526209691)]"
"We keep it upstairs in her room, so it's not like many ""soiled"" diapers even go in there, but when they do, her whole room smells every time you turn the handle.",[]
"We recently went away for the weekend and I soaked the whole thing in bleach, thinking that would help, but a couple of days later, the smell is back.",[]
"For our next baby I will try the ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie and hope we can use it longer than six months.",[]
This one is being taken out of her room.,[]
"I bought the Neat system, and really liked it, but my husband didn't like the fact that you had to use two hands to put in the diaper.",[]
"After about 10 months we decided to try a new system, and opted for the Champ!",[]
Our entire side of our house smelled like baby poop with the Champ.,[]
We then bought the Genie and our entire house smelled like poop and the pail was a pain to use.,[]
I couldn't use it one handed because I had to hold down the lid to turn it( it must have been defective).,[]
"Then after a week of use, our pail stopped twisting the diapers.",[]
"Playtex was very good about returning it, since Babies r Us wouldn't return a used pail (can't say I blame them).",[]
I bought another Neat diaper system and am so happy with it.,[]
"Yes you have to use two hands, but really after the baby is a few months old you can't really hold them up on the table one handed anyways because they are so swirmy.",[]
"This truely is odor free, with the exception of when we change the plastic liner.",[]
"Also, this holds at least twice as many diapers as the Genie or the Champ.",[]
We can go a week without changing the liner if we want to and there is still no odor.,[]
"Everyone complains about the cost of refills verses the Champ, but really, the refill lasts at least a month, so for less than five dollars a month I can have a odor free home and not have to change the pail every two days.",[]
It's totally worth every penny!,[]
"My hubby and I have had both the genie and the champ (one upstairs, one down).",[]
The champ really stunk up the room.,[]
"Each time you flip the lid, odor came out!",[]
"and when you opened it to take out the bag, oh man!!",[]
"The genie doesn't completly hold odor in either, but I don't see how any dispsal system could.",[]
"However, the genie was better at holding the smell better than this thing.",[]
"The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.",[]
"Other than that, you would need a nose plug!",[]
"When I saw this online, I had to go out and buy it.",[]
This thing is great!,[]
"I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.",[]
"The champ can hold twice as many diapers as the genie, and I don't have to run to Target at 10 o'clock at night to buy a refill, I just go and grab a kitchen bag.",[]
"My son helps me after I'm done changing him, I put the diaper in and he pulls the handle.",[]
This thing is incredible!!,[]
!,[]
I originally registered for the Diaper Genie because of the popularity of the product at the time - what a mistake!,[]
"I couldn't get the smell out, no matter how hard I washed it.",[]
"The bags were getting to be SO expensive, and the mere fact that I actually had to squish a dirty diaper down into the pail was nauseating.",[]
I threw out my Genie and gave the Diaper Champ a try - the best decision I ever made!,[]
Just the fact of not having to buy those rediculous refills is enough to make me rave about this product.,[]
But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.,[]
I also love that you don't have to smoosh the dirty diaper into the pail - just turn the handle and the diaper drops right in!,[]
This has been a lifesaver and is going to be even better now that I am expecting my second.,[]
A MUST HAVE for all Moms!,[]
The Diaper Champ doesn't smell - how wonderful!,[]
"Also, there are no expensive bags to buy for it - you can use regular plastic bags!",[]
"Although it seems to fill up quickly(diapers tend to pile up in the middle), this is an absolute must!",[]
Love this product - no smell - easy to change the bags - I don't have any complaints.,[]
We use cloth diapers and the compartment that flips around to drop it into the pail was not big enough.,[]
The diapers got caught in it and ripped the gasket off causing the pail to malfunction.,[]
We had to return it which just puts plastic in the landfill.,[]
It is very difficult to work the latch/blue clip to open the pail.,[]
My guess it that it would work much better for disposables.,[]
I love the Diaper Genie!,[]
It is so convienant and I like how I dont have to buy anything seperate I can just use my own garbage bags!,[]
Great item!,[]
!,[]
The Diaper Champ is so much better than the Diaper Genie.,[]
I can't believe we waited so long to get it (or register for it in this case).,[]
"With our son we used the Diaper Genie (wide mouth), and it worked fine, but it was always a pain to empty, and to buy the refills all the time.",[]
You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.,[]
"But the Diaper Champ, while it costs a little more, is so worth every penny!",[]
"You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.",[]
"It's even fun to put the diaper in the top, flip the handle and have it disappear.",[]
It's almost a little toy for us!,[]
"(I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism).",[]
I highly recommend this product!,[]
"My sister swears by the Diaper Genie, but I've never been wild about it, because my hands aren't big enough to get a good grip on the disk you need to turn to drop the soiled diaper into the pail.",[]
"After reading several reviews on the Diaper Champ, I was impressed that it used regular trash bags & didn't require special (& pricey) refills like the Diaper Genie.",[]
"We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional ""real dirty"" diaper, it does control odor very well.",[]
"It's also easy to operate (you can flip the diaper into the pail with just one hand...or a foot if both your hands are full), & it doesn't matter how big or small your hands are!",[]
"Since I've been a stay-at-home mom, money has been very tight, so it helps that we can use ordinary garbage bags with the Diaper Champ.",[]
"I've told all of my expectant friends about it, & now I've told you.",[]
You'll love it!,[]
I am due to have my 2nd baby in a couple of weeks.,[]
"With my first child, I went with the Diaper Genie and decided that I would give the Champ a try this time.",[]
I had read all the kudo's all the new mommies gave the champ on odor etc.,[]
"Well, I have been using it for a couple of weeks now with my toddler's diapers and you better believe that the pail stinks when you move the handle to dump a diaper.",[]
I am sure it works well for infants who do not have the STINKY toddler diapers.,[]
"Another complaint....the thing is SO easy to use that my toddler loves to put things (other than diapers - pacies, toys etc) into it and flip the handle.",[]
"Overall, it's ok...but I still think the Genie is the better of the two for the long haul.",[]
I can't say enough good things about the Champ.,[]
For my first son we had the Diaper Genie - but it didn't do the trick.,[]
"(too $$ and too difficult to handle).For son #2, I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.",[]
I still love it!,[]
"My son (who is now 3+ years old) is finally getting potty trained, but we still use it to hold the ""nightie night dypes""...  We've been using it for 3+ years and it is still going strong.According to the reviews, I was careful to wrap the diapers before putting them in - which we had to do for the Genie anyway... For the REALLY MESSY ones, I flipped up the lid and placed it right in the bag - which was easy to do.My son still loves to pull the handle and say ""bye-bye"" to what he considers the magic trash can.",[]
"For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.",[]
"If the odor inside gets too strong, try using Febreeze -- it even works on the plastic!Strongly MOM Approved!",[]
!,[]
I love the diaper champ.,[]
Trashbags are an economical and no fuss option to the pricey diaper genie inserts.,[]
Plus it's user friendly.,[]
I would highly recommend this product!,[]
!,[]
It is so much easier to use than the Diaper Genie (my sister has that) but it does have some problems.,[]
"We've used it for a year now, and it never started to smell until the diapers did.",[]
It generally only smells when it's really full or you're emptying it out.,[]
I wouldn't say the smell is such a problem though.,[]
Whenever I empty out the bag (love the fact you can use regular trash bags) I would wipe out the inside and saturate it with Lycol for disinfecting.,[]
"The only reason why I am going to have to buy the Diaper Genie now is that my 1 year old loves to put items (sippy cups, toys, etc.)",[]
into the hole in the top and flip the handle.,[]
"I didn't realize he could do this until one day when a sippy cup went missing, and after EXTENSIVE searching I found it inside the diaper pail!",[]
"Since then, I have caught him many times trying to do the same thing.",[]
"Over all, it's a good product.",[]
"I think if you smell strong odors coming from the Diaper Champ, it's time to clean and empty it!",[]
After reading all the good reviews on this pail I went out and bought it.,[]
I'm soooo disappointed!,[]
IT STINKS so bad...it doesn't hold the odour what so ever!,[]
My wife and I looked at the size of the Diaper Genie and realized that it was much smaller then the Champ.,[]
In addition we didn't want the extra cost of purchsing specially made diaper pail liners.,[]
With the champ we can purchase the bulk garbage bag liners at Costco for th  Champ refills.,[]
The only slight Negative is the lid release.,[]
It is at times difficult to open.,[]
But other then this  we are quite satisfied.,[]
"I have heard a lot of negativity about the Diaper Genie, plus it's cost was outrageous with the liners and all.",[]
My baby is 7 months old and this thing works great!,[]
It keeps the smell out.,[]
We empty it twice a week and keep it clean with some Clorox wipes and Lysol.,[]
"I did a lot of research on diaper pails and liked the reviews this one got, along with the price.",[]
"Plus, we use the pretty scented garbage bags and they fit perfectly!",[]
This thing is great!,[]
It uses a standard kitchen trash bag.,[]
My daughter has had smelly diapers for 3 months now and we have yet to smell anything coming from the diaper pail.,[]
The lid locks tight too so that you don't have to worry about curious little hands getting inside.,[]
"We contemplated going with the diaper genie, but some friends of ours had it and weren't happy with it.",[]
We did some research online and decided to try the diaper champ.,[]
We have been very happy with it so far.,[]
"Our son's diapers are definitely not odor free anymore, but the diaper champ keeps the odor in.",[]
We like that it uses our regular trash bags.,[]
We spray it with lysol and let it set after emptying and before replacing the bag.,[]
The only problem we have noticed is you don't know that it is full until you turn the handle and the plunger doesn't go all the way down; which is easily solved by pushing it down manually and then changing the bag.,[]
We would definitely recomend the diaper champ.,[]
"I received a DiaperGenie for my baby shower and promptly exchanged it for a Diaper Champ, after I had done some research.",[]
"I LOVE being able to use regular trash bags instead of refills, but it does occasionally release a bad odor.",[]
"I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.",[]
"No matter what kind of housekeeper you are, the Diaper Champ has a flip-flop top, so whenever you dispose a diaper, the bottom becomes the top and odors are released.",[]
I finally solved this problem by sprinkling a little baking soda on the bottom of the can and occasionally sprinkling a little down the top.,[]
It absorbs the odors from within and has worked wonderfully.,[]
"Overall, I am very pleased with this product!!",[]
!,[]
This was a gift to my friend and I'm told it works well.,[]
Keeps everything nice and tidy.,[]
I would get this if I had kids.,[]
"Easier to use than the Diaper Genie, less expensive in the long run because you don't have to buy special bags for it.",[]
I love it.,[]
"As expected, as baby gets older, they may be slightly less effective at locking in odor.",[]
"But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.",[]
"Also, my sister-in-law used the Genie and she hated emptying it because she hated pulling out, ""this long strand of smelly diapers, like a big sausage""If you do want to take that little extra step to mask odors with the Champ, here's what I did...I went to a local wholesale store like Smart & Final or Costco and bought a roll of plastic bags (the kind that you use in the grocery store to put your fruits and vegetables in).","[('genie', 0.0724135785035745)]"
A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).,[]
"It provides that extra odor protection if you wrap up the diaper in a little baggie, then drop it in the Champ.",[]
It also helps mask the odor when you have to actually open up the Champ to empty a full bag.,[]
"Again, this little step is not necessary, but I find that it makes emptying a full Champ a little less unpleasant.",[]
My husband and I registered for the Diaper Champ without really knowing much about it.,[]
We picked it because it did not require purchasing refills like the Diaper Genie (which my sister-in-law had and did not really like).,[]
We really like our Diaper Champ because it does not require refills (it uses regular kitchen trash bags)and it keeps out odor completely.,[]
I am recommending this to all my pregnant friends.,[]
"I've never felt compelled to write a review before, but those who say they have no smell w/their Diaper Champ must have kids that don't have stinky poop.",[]
My husband changes the bag out every day and it's still terrible.,[]
"We have a 3-1/2 year old (nearly potty trained) and an 18 month old, and even just urine diapers smell up the room in this thing.",[]
"The mechanism is easy to use, which is why I gave it 2 stars.",[]
That's my only compliment.We've had a Diaper Genie for over 3 years and wanted to replace it b/c some of the parts had broken (hinge on the lid).,[]
So I bought this based on Amazon recommendations.,[]
I'm now planning on giving it to a friend (who likes her Diaper Champ) and buying another Diaper Genie.,[]
Not much of a smell w/those.,[]
"And yes, you do have to buy the refills w/a Diaper Genie, but they last a long time (2-3 months on average) and if I'm having to throw away a regular trash bag every day to manage the smell of my Diaper Champ, I think the cost just about evens out.One more thing about my Diaper Genie.",[]
We have two diaper pails - one for upstairs and one down.,[]
I've already bought one new Diaper Genie and my big complaints of the 3 year old model I'm replacing have been fixed.,[]
There's no more ring anymore (those of you who have older Genies will know what I'm talking about).,[]
The refill bags just set down in there now - so much easier!,[]
It's so much nicer and contains smells great.,[]
So I'm going for my second new Diaper Genie to replace my Diaper Champ.,[]
My son is now 18 months old and I have to say that the diaper champ is one of our favorite purchases!,[]
"We got it when I was pregnant in hopes it would keep our house smelling ok. Well, it does pretty well at that, you still have to change it out everyday, it is poop however!!!",[]
But the thing I love most is that I can just use my kroger bags!!,[]
"With buying diapers and toys, I didn't need something else on my list to buy!",[]
What a great invention!!!,[]
!,[]
... than deal with the odor from this pail.,[]
"Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn't help.",[]
We've moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery.,[]
"I was a nanny before becoming pregnant, so I knew about the Diaper Genie, and I didn't like how it worked.",[]
(It makes dirty diaper sausages.),[]
My husband and I shopped and talked with other parents before purchasing this item.,[]
We both love it!,[]
"The Diaper Champ is easy to manage, keeps the room smelling clean, and you can use any bag with it which saves you money!",[]
We are telling all of our expecting friends about this item!,[]
"I LOVED my Champ for the first year as it was all I expected in ease, cleanliness, odor free with regular bag changes and the economical use of kitchen bags.",[]
"Then the liner began to come loose and get stuck in the tumbler and eventually had to be removed altogether making things a bit less odor resistant, but still manageable with regular bag changes, cleanings, airings and sprinklings of baking soda.","[('stuck', 0.10549480957565062)]"
The real problem we have now is that no amount of cleaning and deoderizing the Champ after a bag change (about twice a week for us) has managed to eliminate the strong odor that seems to be clinging to the actual pail now.,[]
"We've tried a number of disinfectants, deoderizers and air freshners, but they are no match for the offensive odor of the Champ even when clean and empty.",[]
We are so disappointed in the short-term success of this product.,[]
It has been removed from my son's room and we are now taking each diaper out individually and looking for another pail.,[]
I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.,[]
"In light of our experience with the Champ, I'd have to recommend not purchasing this pail unless you are prepared to replace it when it fails to do it's no-odor diaper duty in due time.",[]
I have a two-year-old son and I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
"We initially bought a Diaper Genie and used it for the first 9 months or so, but we really disliked it.",[]
"It was difficult to use, loud, and then broke on us.",[]
We switched the Diaper Champ and love it.,[]
It contains our toddler's odors just fine.,[]
We change the bag once a week and when we change a diaper we make sure to roll it up tightly and use the sticky tabs to close it up.,[]
I registered for the Diaper Genie and used it for 9 months until I got totally fed up with it.,[]
It smelled so bad and was so hard to use and those refills are [expensive].,[]
"I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.",[]
"Just drop the diaper in and turn it over, in it goes, its as easy as 1--2--!!!",[]
"Its great to empty too, the front door opens and you can pull the bag right out....no fumbling to open the bottom of the unit and pull out those ""Sausages"" like the Diaper Genie.",[]
It so easy and so great I love it!!,[]
I would recommend it to anyone.,[]
It beats the competition!,[]
!,[]
We bought the diaper champ because you could use your own bags and didn't have to buy the expensive refills.,[]
At first it was great.,[]
The only time we smelled something was when it was time to change the bag.,[]
Once my son started on solids I started smelling it more.,[]
So I changed the bag more frequently.,[]
"That worked for a while, but now nothing works.",[]
"I took the champ outside cleaned it with clorox clean up, sprayed it with lysol and left it open outside for two days.",[]
"As soon as the first poopy diaper went in, the smell returned.",[]
We are on the look out for a new one.,[]
Don't waste your money!!,[]
!,[]
The Diaper Champ is great mainly because you can use any type of garbage bag with it.,[]
You are not a slave to the Genie type bags.,[]
Also it keeps odors inside.,[]
"I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.",[]
So I know the Champ is doing a great job keeping the stink inside where it belongs.,[]
I think it holds a lot of diapers too eliminating trips to the trash.,[]
This helps since we live in a condo with stairs.,[]
I would definitely chose this again if I had too.,[]
I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.,[]
This might help:  When placing the trashbag in the Diaper Champ (BIG plus--- uses regular trashbags!!,[]
"), open the bag just enough to place the bag properly.",[]
Squeeze any air out of the bag before closing the lid.,[]
"I think some people are opening the bag and filling it with air (like I do for the kitchen trashcan), and this smelly air will escape when a diaper is placed inside.",[]
I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
I had the Diaper Genie for my 5 year old and I hated it.,[]
It smelled and it was easier to walk each diaper outside to the trash then have to change the refills.,[]
The diaper champ takes regular bags and is very easy to change.,[]
Best of all...NO SMELL!!!!,[]
!,[]
"After reading the reviews on both, I was undecided whether to buy the Diaper Genie or the Diaper Champ.",[]
So I bought both and tried them side-by-side.,[]
"I got the Genie on sale for $19, plus the an extra insert for $5.",[]
I bought the Champ for $25 after a $5 coupon.,[]
I brought them home and first set up the Genie for it's two-week test run.,[]
I loved it.,[]
"Since it seals each diaper individually, you don't have to throw out a whole bag for a few days worth of diapers.",[]
"And yes, you'll want to empty it out every three to four days.",[]
"But that's no problem: press the cut button, give it a turn, two at the most, take the unit to the garbage and open the bottom.",[]
The sausage links fall out and you tie up the top again.,[]
"Easy, clean, no need to mess with the diapers themselves.Then I set up the Champ.",[]
It almost got boxed up its first day.,[]
It did almost nothing to control the smell.,[]
"So I emptied it out and exchanged it, thinking I must have bought a defective one.",[]
Nope.,[]
The next one was just as bad.,[]
I could smell the first messy diaper immediately.,[]
"Essentially, it's a trash can with an allegedly smell proof lid, but it can't even accomplish that.",[]
"Then when it's time to empty it out, you are back to emptying a trash can, which means opening the lid, exposing the diapers to the air, and throwing out an essentially empty garbage bag.",[]
You will change the bag every day or two.,[]
It smells bad.,[]
Very.,[]
"So it's all well and fine that you can use any suitably sized trash bag in it, but you'll go through them that much faster, too.",[]
"To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.",[]
"The Champ may be nice for newborns with their odorless diapers, since all you have to do is insert diaper and flip the handle, but in my opinion, by the time your kids get to solid foods and the resulting odor, stick with the Genie.","[('stick', 0.08916266806165124)]"
"Incidentally, one insert lasted me one month for a one-year-old and a three-year-old who has occasional accidents in her nap-time pull-up.",[]
I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift.,[]
This is much easier to use.,[]
You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.,[]
I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.,[]
I am really disappointed with this product.,[]
"It really starts to smell after one day (and my baby is only 8 weeks old and is on breastmilk), which of course causes the baby's room to smell.",[]
By the end of the second day the room is pretty stinky.,[]
"The way you open it is very poorly designed, making it difficult to open -- half the time I hurt a finger or break a nail.",[]
"My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.",[]
"so you then have to go in there and tear the diaper off and try to pull  out the little stuck piece, which is very difficult to do and incredibly aggravating.",[]
This product STINKS!,[]
I am now trying to decide between a diaper genie and a diaper dekor or just using a regular diaper pail.,[]
This is a good product.,[]
"It allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers, wipes, etc.",[]
and does not require any special bags.,[]
"Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with it getting stuck.",[]
"It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!",[]
"If you change the bag regularly, you should not have any problem with odor.",[]
This is a great product and a good value for those on a budjet.,[]
Using lysol after changing the bag works well.,[]
I have used my Diaper champ for 3 years and it still works!!,[]
I recommed this product to everyone I know.,[]
I BOUGHT 3 DIFFERENT ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE.,[]
THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN BAG ITS USER FRIENDLY AND IT KEEPS THE SMELL OUT.,[]
I also opted for the Diaper Champ because there isn't any refills.,[]
"It is very easy to use, but is difficult to open.",[]
I'm afraid of ripping a fingernail completely off everytime I change the bag.,[]
My problem is with odor control.,[]
There isn't any.,[]
My newborn daughter's room smells constantly.,[]
It only takes ONE poopy diaper to smell.,[]
Yes we do change the bag regularly per other posts.,[]
We had to keep a fan on in her room during the summer just to keep the odor from a choking level.,[]
No exaggeration!,[]
"If the smell wasn't a problem, I'd completely recommend this product.",[]
I got this item in my baby shower.,[]
It does the job well.,[]
I have no odors in my baby's room.,[]
I have to agree with another reviewer.,[]
"You can't expect this diaper pail to magically clean itself and ""get rid"" of the diapers for you.",[]
"You still have to empty the bag, replace it and maybe once in while wipe the pail for freshness.",[]
I change the bag once a week and no odors here.,[]
When I was pregnant I was ready to register for the Diaper Genie because that was the only product I knew about.,[]
After talking to many co-workers my husband mentioned that most were actually recommending a new product called the Diaper Champ.,[]
In the end we went with the Champ and our son is now 16 months old and our Champ is still working great.,[]
Our son eats all solid foods and we have no problems with odors.,[]
The reviewers who are complaining about odor problems must be closing it improperly or doing something else wrong.,[]
Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.,[]
I would highly recommend this product to anyone.,[]
"I did a lot of research into all of the products we purchased for our baby, reading opinions, talking to friends with children, etc.",[]
I feel like we made a great choice with this diaper pail.,[]
What I like the most is the fact you can use any bag you want.,[]
I purchased a roll of vanilla scented bags at Target and I have barely made a dent in them.,[]
(My daughter is 3 1/2 months old).,[]
I also had a problem with the diaper tabs getting caught in the shoot and clogging things up.,[]
"Once I realized the problem I just made sure to wrap up the diapers and secure them shut with the tabs, problem solved.",[]
I have not had any problems with odor.,[]
"We are feeding with formula so we definitely have some ripe diapers, but once they are in the pail the odor is contained.",[]
We change the bag every 2-3 days (which seems reasonable to me) and with each change I Lysol out the inside of the pail.,[]
No odor problems at all.,[]
I think the pail is easy to use and I have had no problems opening the pail to change the bags.,[]
"After using other brands at friends' homes I feel this pail is easier, and more importantly, cheaper to use.",[]
"You don't need to spend all that money on expensive bags, we just use our regular kitchen trash bags with the champ.",[]
"No smells, super easy to use, couldn't be happier.",[]
It's so much better then the diaper genie.,[]
No special bags necessary!,[]
Occasionally there are some bad odors but it's nothing that can't be fixed with some febreeze or lysol!,[]
Let us just get to the basics...Easy to use & No extra bags to buy!,[]
"!I use the trash bags that our regular household trashcan uses (scented vanilla from Target), but you can use regular trash bags.Any stinky diaper left long enough will eventually well smell!!",[]
but with the extra vanilla scent-well I am happy!,[]
"and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.",[]
"Drop the diaper in, flip the handle, VOILA ready for the next diaper....I am a firm believer is easy to use, cost savings, and time saver.We are perfectly happy with this product and recommend it!","[('diaper', 0.096633526209691)]"
I had a diaper Genie and couldn't open it with one hand.,[]
Every time I wanted to dipose of a diaper it frustrated me because I didn't want my baby on the changing table without one hand on her.,[]
I bought the diaper champ last week and I swear I smile ever time I use it!,[]
"It is so easy to use, takes regular trash bags instead of expensive liners and the only time it sticks a little is when it is almost full.",[]
"Otherwise, works perfect and makes my life so much easier.",[]
During this stressful time; why add additional stress.,[]
Do yourself a favor and spend the money on this valuable item!,[]
We had the older diaper champ for years and loved it.,[]
The handle broke off so we bought a new one.,[]
"Perhaps our problem is that we are using it will pull-ups and not diapers but everytime we turn it over, it gets stuck and I have to open it up and push the diaper down.",[]
The thing is useless.,[]
It frustrates everyone.,[]
I'm going to try to find an older model on Ebay.,[]
I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.,[]
I would never recommend this product to anyone.,[]
This as got to be the worst diaper pail ever it stinks out the whole room.,[]
I too wanted to save on bags (big mistake).,[]
I can not stand it any longer.,[]
It is out!,[]
I love this diaper pail so much!!,[]
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!,[]
The Diaper Champ is so easy & can be done with one hand & have never noticed a a smell.,[]
You will not regret a thing if you purchase this pail.,[]
This champ is so easy.,[]
Just drop in and turn.,[]
"Yes, it does fill in the center, but if you shake the pail you can get a few more diapers in.",[]
We use a scented bags and are changing more frequently now because my daughter has larger diapers.,[]
When she was a newborn we could go a week.,[]
The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.,[]
"There is no comparison- this is Yes, the best, it does smell when it is opened to remove the bag, however, I expect that - think about what you are putting in there!!",[]
"The odor does not remain in the room, but if it did, I would use common sense and change the bag somewhere else.",[]
Other pails require that you purchase their bags - have you actually sat down and figured out how much additional money you are spending?,[]
"Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.",[]
"Bottom line - if you want a pail that is economical and practical, this is the pail for you.",[]
We ordered the Diaper Champ after the lid broke on our Diaper Genie.,[]
We really liked the idea of being able to use regular trash bags instead of special refills.,[]
"Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.",[]
"First off all, the opening for the dirty diapers is small and tube shaped so you have to be sure that the diaper is perfectly folded to make sure you don't get ""waste"" on it.",[]
"Secondly, it does NOT keep the smell in.",[]
"Ever since we got the Diaper Champ, my sons room smells like pee!",[]
We have been taking poopy diapers to outside trash immediatley and using plastic grocery bags to put pee pee diapers in before putting them in the Diaper Champ so this product has defintiley not saved us time and we are using more plastic than we used before which is what we did not want!,[]
"Honeslty, we will probably sell this or give it away and buy another Diaper Genie.",[]
My baby's room has absolutely NO odor because of the Diaper Champ.,[]
The chamber holds many diapers ( a day full at least) with no odor at all.,[]
I also love that it takes regular trash bags so it's economical.,[]
"I spray the top and handle daily with Lysol or use Clorox wipes in the receptacle to keep it sanitary, but otherwise NO ODORS leak out!",[]
We change the trash bag daily but you could get away with two days.,[]
We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners.,[]
"The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated, but at a certain level of the room (usually nose-height when you're sitting on the floor) you can still smell poo.",[]
It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole.,[]
"Overall, we are very satisfied.",[]
Our experiences with the Champ have been mixed.,[]
"Not only have diapers gotten stuck in the cylinder and been torn in the &quot;dropping&quot; process, but they also get stuck when the champ is moderately full.",[]
The odor does leak quite often when in a small space (the closet) or even when in the bedroom.,[]
Not to mention the pure stench when changing bags.,[]
It's enough to knock out a postpartum mom with strong &quot;smell indicators&quot; still working.The convenience of using regular garbage bags is definitley the biggest plus in this contraption.,[]
I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one.,[]
I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives.,[]
"Now, owning one myself, I agree.",[]
I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags.,[]
You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up!,[]
My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars.,[]
"First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often.",[]
"Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags.",[]
The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy.,[]
It probably happens to everyone at least once.,[]
Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.,[]
We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.,[]
I would recommend that you open the box to check the pail if you are purchasing it at the store.,[]
We took ours home and the lid couldn't open all the way so we had to do an exchange.,[]
We haven't experienced any odors and having no need to purchase special bags for it is a wonderful convenience.Here's an update.,[]
My baby is now 11 months old and the poop is more potent now thanks to the solids we've introduced.,[]
I've noticed the Champ is losing it's power when the pail starts to fill up.,[]
"So as effective as it was during breastmilk poop stage, it still works well for us but we have to change the bag just a tad earlier now.",[]
We read all the reviews and wanted the convenience of using regular bags.,[]
"After using the Champ for 1 month I have to say that it does control the odors so far.HOWEVER, it is sometimes very difficult to open it up.",[]
*Sometimes it will tip over if you don't lift the hatch perfectly.,[]
*The diapers we use are size 1 and we wrap them up tight.,[]
They STILL get stuck in the plunger.,[]
The hole is too small for the diapers to go on.,[]
I'll open it and there are 3 diapers stuck in the hole.,[]
"Unless you perfectly place the diaper, wrapped super tight, they will get stuck.",[]
I can't imagine what will happen when the diapers get larger.I am disappointed overall with this product.,[]
I would like to see these concerns addressed by the company.,[]
Hope this helps!,[]
I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced.,[]
We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us.,[]
"No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean.",[]
"Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out.",[]
Big mistake!!!,[]
Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.,[]
Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces.,[]
I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.,[]
I think some people out there are expecting too much from a product that is designed to hold human waste.,[]
It smells.,[]
Short of casting a magic spell on it that's how life is.,[]
I love this product because it keeps the smell from becoming a serious issue in the baby's room.,[]
"As long as you change the bags when they're full and clean the pail like it tells you to, I haven't found there to be a big problem.",[]
Lysol also really helps.,[]
It helps in between cleanings.,[]
I just am grateful that they've come out with stuff like this and other diaper pails since I was born.,[]
I bought this pail because I didn't want to have to pay for expensive liners.,[]
I buy the scented kind from walmart.,[]
One less thing to worry about.,[]
Do yourself a favor and buy this diaper pail.,[]
"There is NO smell, it uses any trash bag and it's EASY to use and to change the bags out.",[]
I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!),[]
just to come here and write a review for this.,[]
The Diaper Champ really is the only logical choice - you won't be sorry you bought.,[]
"There is minimal smell, you can use tall kitchen bags, and it's so easy to use and empty - this is a GREAT product.",[]
"I was in line at BRU, and two other mothers just nodded their heads and praised the Diaper Champ.",[]
"I got it, and I'll be doing the same to other newbee mommys out there!",[]
This thing freakin' stinks.,[]
Literally.,[]
I changed the bags every 1-2 days and wiped with clorox wipes and sprayed with lysol AND used vanilla scented bagsand we could still smell the smells seeping through!!,[]
Now I just throw the diapers in the regular trash since I change the bags everyday anyway and we can't smell a thing now.,[]
Someone else told me this thing stinks and I should have listened to them.,[]
I loved the Diaper Champ until it would no longer work!,[]
We've only had it 2 and 1/2 months and it's broken.,[]
"It could just be ours, but I thought I would write a review anyway.",[]
I don't think we'll buy another one.,[]
We'll just be grocery bagging it from now on!,[]
I love the diaper Champ my child is 2 1/2 years old and I just started to have problems with the scents of diapers recently :(  I called Baby Trend and they told me the gaskets need to be replaced every 6 to 8 months.,[]
They are sending some out at no charge to me!,[]
So I think this product is great.,[]
"It uses normal kitchen garbage bags no expensive refills, it keeps little hands away from the diapers and I only have to change the bag about once a week and she is 2 1/2 years old.",[]
Wonderfull product as long as the gaskets work when I change them :),[]
"We've got 2 sets of twins, and we couldn't be more pleased with this product!",[]
It's a real money saver for parents with twins.,[]
You end up spending so much money on Diaper Genie refills.,[]
"I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.",[]
The Diaper Champ is a LOT better than a regular garbage can.,[]
It allows you to use plain garbage bags and it keeps more of the smell in.Reality check: Diaper pails stink.,[]
All of them.Here's what we do with the Diaper Champ:We put a set of &quot;Stick-Ups&quot; in it.,[]
"One in the bottom, one in the top.",[]
"Change the air fresheners about once a month.If you've got twins, you're changing the garbage bag almost every day, so the smells don't have as much time to &quot;ferment&quot; (ha, ha!",[]
)I don't think it's difficult to open and close either.,[]
You'll get the hang of it.,[]
This diaper pail is definitely the best.,[]
"We have 18 month old triplets, so it gets its fair share of use.",[]
I have not detected any smells coming from our champ that we use downstairs.,[]
"The one we use upstairs has a faintest odor coming from it, but only occassionally.",[]
"I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.",[]
"Plus, I always spray Lysol in the one downstairs- I recommend doing this.",[]
"This champ uses regular garbage bags, it is so easy to use, you can do it one handed.",[]
"My husband and I actually threw out the Genie, we hated it.",[]
Definitely buy this one.,[]
"We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.",[]
"And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.",[]
"It also helps if you leave the used wipes inside the diaper.Super duty deposited may require putting the diaper in a grocery bag before putting it in the pail.All in all,  I think the price is worth it.",[]
And not having to use any special bags.,[]
I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.,[]
It works great.,[]
"I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).",[]
I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.,[]
It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.,[]
The reviews were definitely right.,[]
"I loved the diaper champ for the first 6 months - very simple to use, no refills, etc.",[]
"When you begin to feed solid foods, watch out for the smell.",[]
phew!,[]
"Our champ has moved to the garage so that the nursery will still smell like a baby.I do change the bags frequently, wash it, spray with Lysol, etc.",[]
Nothing seems to work.I'm not sure they'll every make a diaper pail with complete odor control.,[]
Let's hope they keep trying!,[]
This is such a great product that we got one for upstairs and downstairs.,[]
"Like previous posters said, you do have to clean the thing!",[]
We just spray it down w lysol once a week and make sure to change it sometimes before the bag is full.,[]
It is easy and quick way to dispose of diapers; much better than the alternative of emptying the garbage every day.,[]
"We never heard anything good about the [other diaper pails], so we gave the Champ a try - out of all the items we were given and purchased, this is by far the best purchase.",[]
No odor at all!,[]
Easy to use!LOVE IT - will buy it for any moms to be!!!,[]
!,[]
"Works fine, but a foot operated trash can will likely do the same for less.",[]
Almost bought a diaper genie and then read on-line reviews.,[]
Glad we listened!,[]
Very easy to use.,[]
Easy to open to empty and easy to replace trash bags.,[]
Nice that you can use regular trash bags from any store.,[]
"So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.",[]
If you look at the picture you might understand.,[]
"After you flip the handle, the diaper on the inside goes into the bag when the cylinder you place it in is vertical, or completely upside down.",[]
"On the sides, there are walls that are snug to the round part that flips around.",[]
It is between the round diaper flipper thing and the walls that stuff could potentially get caught.,[]
It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.,[]
We still recommend this product.,[]
I received this as a baby shower gift after I had registered for it.,[]
"The main reason that I picked it was because I did not like the idea of having to buy the special cartridges for the Diaper Genie, so this was perfect.",[]
"My son is now six months old, and I haven't regreted my decision yet.",[]
It holds in the odors extremely well.,[]
"I will admit that oder does escape whenever you change the bag, so I just take it outside, where my trash can is anyway, and dump it there.",[]
I wanted it to keep the smell down when diapers were in it.,[]
"Therefore, if the only time I might catch a whiff of them is when I change the bag, big deal!",[]
It does what I want it to do!,[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.,[]
"However, diapers get stuck frequently and you then have to take off the lid to deal with it.",[]
Kind of a pain.,[]
I like this diaper pail for the most part.,[]
It does a pretty good job of keeping the odor in.,[]
I like that you can use any bag with it.,[]
I just bought a roll of cheap kitchen bags.,[]
"The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.",[]
I would recommend this product for its simplicity and effectiveness.,[]
"We've had the Diaper Champ for 18 months, and it worked great, no smells, very easy to use, until recently.",[]
Somehow (probably it got overloaded) the adhesive from a diaper snagged the foam that insulates the head of the champ and pulled just the teeniest tiniest corner out.,[]
"Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.",[]
"We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.",[]
Check you Champ carefully to make sure that no mesh or foam are visible.,[]
the latch to open when changing bags is very unconfortable.,[]
when it opens makes the pail go all out of balance.,[]
it does keep the smell out though.,[]
it sometimes smells if it has not been emptied in 2 or so days.,[]
"it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.",[]
"If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.",[]
"When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills.",[]
"Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.",[]
"Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!",[]
"!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!",[]
I think it is great!,[]
After reading through these reviews I knew I had to leave my own two cents.,[]
I can't believe some of the things others are complaining about!,[]
"Oh the trash bag stinks when you are changing it Well duh, it has 1 week old DIRTY DIAPERS in it!!",[]
"!Some people are also saying that you can smell the dirty diapers as soon as their kids started solids, well I've had my Champ for 8 months, my son is 9 months old and let me tell you, he lets some real bombs go!",[]
But I can't smell a thing with the Champ.,[]
I can't imagine what those other kids diapers smell like that they leaking out of the Diaper Champ!,[]
"Besides that, We are talking about dirty diapers, try ripping your septic tank out of the ground, put it in your living room and see how wonderful your crap smells!One person said ""Poo Poo diapers when not put in the lid properly, gets the Champs lid soiled"" Well duh!","[('champs', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"Put the ""poo poo"" diapers in the right way and you won't have that problem!And last but not least, someone said that this pail wasn't big enough and that she was changing the bag too often.",[]
"Well, how big of a trash can would you really want?",[]
Would one the size of your child's crib be big enough?,[]
"And about having to change the bag often, once again we are talking about DIRTY DIAPERS!!!",[]
You should be changing the bag every few days or at the very least once a week!I just found some of these comments quite funny.,[]
"Seems that some of these ladies are expecting ""it all"" with this diaper pail.",[]
"Well the truth is that this is a great pail, you can use regular trash bags so not only is the diaper pail itself quite inexpensive, you also don't have to buy expensive refills, the smell is very little to none at all, and it IS big enough.",[]
What's not to like?,[]
Five stars from me!,[]
"I have one for the nursery and one downstairs in what we call our ""satellite"" nursery where we keep our pack & play.",[]
"My daughter is nearly 8 mos now, and we use both of them pretty equally.",[]
"However, the one in the nursery is smelly, the one downstairs you can't detect the slightest odor from.",[]
We change both of them out at least 2-3x/week.,[]
"I tried cleaning out the smelly one, getting the foam soaked with lysol and letting it dry out in the hot LV sun - I figured the scorching heat alone would kill anything, but I can still detect an odor from it - it doesn't stink up the whole nursery, but if you're standing right next to it you get a whiff.",[]
The foam inside has just absorbed the stink and there's no getting rid of it.,[]
"All of this being said, I don't know that there is any other diaper pail that is much better - my brother has a diaper genie and he says it stinks a lot, he has to change his every day.",[]
My girlfriend has tried a few different pails and doesn't think any one is better than another.,[]
My husband and I wanted this style (vs. the Diaper Genie) because it uses regular kitchen trash bags.,[]
This is a more efficient way to go both because you can buy these bags anywhere and they are less expensive compared to the specialty bags for the Genie.,[]
The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.,[]
"Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and recommend it highly.",[]
This is easy to use.,[]
Can't smell anything.,[]
I can use my own bags.,[]
My older kids love to toss the diapers.,[]
It is neat and actually kinda fun to use.,[]
LOVE IT~~,[]
"Just like everyone else, we were uncertain about which diaper pail to buy.",[]
We decided on the Diaper Champ beacuse it didn't use specific refills.,[]
Little did we know the real benefit of this device.,[]
"After our first night out after the baby came, we came home to find our Diaper champ across the house.",[]
We have 2 60lb dogs.,[]
They had unsuccesfully tried to get into the Diaper Champ.,[]
There is nothing they can do to open it.,[]
Since that day they don't give it another thought.,[]
I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.,[]
"I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.",[]
"We have to change the bag every couple of days, when it is not even full because it is pretty disgusting.So just because of that I would not recommend it.",[]
This is  a great buy!,[]
"Easy to use and yes, no smells.",[]
"It's a great item to have for the nursery because it's not too big and looks nice, too.",[]
This is a great product!,[]
It is excellent since you can use your own trash bags in it and don't have to buy special ones.,[]
You can also put the diaper in it using only 1 hand!,[]
"I gave it 4 stars only since 'once in a while' if the bag is very full, I may notice a slight smell.",[]
But it is truly worth buying!,[]
I love mine!,[]
I bought the Champ because I didn't want to have to buy the special bags for the Genie and at first it worked great.,[]
Very easy just to flip the top with one hand.,[]
Sometimes a wipe would get stuck between the plunger and the outer lid and would need to be pulled out.,[]
One day when the Champ was only about 3 or 4 months old I pulled out what I thought was a wipe and it was the liner that had come disconnected.,[]
Ever since that liner came out it has not kept the odor in.,[]
I have been changing the bags every couple of days and dumping baby powder in the new bags to absorb the smell but I'm through playing around with this thing and I'm getting a different diaper pail.,[]
"The reason their are mixed reviews on the Diaper Champ is because not all Diaper Champs are created equal (hee, hee).",[]
We purchased one and we loved it.,[]
"No odor, we loved that you could use any bag, we were very happy.",[]
"So happy, we bought a second one.",[]
OH MY GAH!,[]
It was horrid.,[]
"The odors were so strong we thought our nursery maybe toxic (not really, smile).",[]
"We thought maybe it was just us, so we called in for a second opinion (the Mother-in-law).",[]
"She started gagging, and that was our sign to bring in the gas masks and rid of the Diaper Champ.",[]
"Ok , so after reading some of the reviews - we got this one when our baby was born - We really liked the fact that it uses regular trash bags - we just went to the wholesale club and bought a large box of them!",[]
And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!,[]
It really works well and while you do catch an occational whiff of something - it holds the stink well.,[]
"In fact so well, you won't even believe it when you open it up to change the bag!",[]
Hold your breath!!!,[]
But overall - definitely would recommend it over anything that needs costly refills.,[]
"The manufacturer's package insert states that if you return this item, it cannot be resold and will go directly to the landfill.",[]
"(This may be true of all diaper disposal systems, but this was the first I'd heard about it.",[]
")While it seems like the Diaper Champ might work well enough, I'm concerned that the chute where diapers are dropped will be difficult to clean.",[]
"There's a round weight that moves back and forth inside this chute, and it seems to me a dirty wipe could easily soil the outside of the chute and the outside of the weight (the part that slides along the chute).",[]
This part of the Champ would be really difficult to clean.,[]
"I'd rather stick with our small, lidded trashcan.",[]
"I feel guilty about returning it, though...I may have to freecycle it instead.",[]
"My son is now 2 years old, and we are still using this product.",[]
"But it had to be moved outside after about 12 months.It worked extremely well at being odor-free until my kid started eating solid food in quantity and then... phew!I've seen a lot of diaper pails in action, including some Diaper Genies and I have to say there is nothing, NOTHING out there that is truly odor-free unless you're changing the bag every couple of days or more.",[]
"And if you ARE changing the bag every couple of days, then almost any tightly sealed container will do.",[]
Poop and pee stink.,[]
"Scientists have not conquered this problem, no matter what the package says.The reason I would recommend the Champ over the Genie and every other diaper pail I've seen is that it really is sealed.",[]
"A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.",[]
"I've seen several Genies that can't be kept sealed easily, although in theory they seem childproof.If it weren't for the risk of a toddler getting into it, I'd say just go with a garbage can.",[]
Honestly.,[]
There is no difference.,[]
Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.,[]
"In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands.",[]
"I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids.",[]
"I also use the Glad ""Odor-Control"" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).",[]
The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.,[]
I highly recommend it.,[]
Love this diaper pail!,[]
I had had some experience with Diaper Genie in our church nursery before my daughter was born and could never quite get the hang of it.,[]
The Diaper Champ is wonderful.,[]
I'm amazed when I empty it at how much stink it is actually holding inside.,[]
And the fact that you don't have to buy expensive refills is an added bonus!,[]
I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents .,[]
.,[]
.When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie.,[]
She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
"My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her .",[]
.,[]
".When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.",[]
"Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?",[]
"True, the mechanism sometimes won't ""swing"" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.",[]
"Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don't change it regularly .",[]
.,[]
.,[]
but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn't clean it out regularly .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
"if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ's, Costco or Sam's check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.",[]
The BJ's we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.,[]
"As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don't change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.",[]
I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.,[]
I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
"At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.",[]
"All of my friends swore by the Diaper Genie, but while we were registering at Babies R' Us we decided to go for the Diaper Champ and I am so glad we did!",[]
The Diaper Champ makes life so much easier.,[]
We don't notice a smell but we empty it often.,[]
Why leave dirty diapers around??,[]
It's easy to use in the middle of the night too!,[]
I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!,[]
We just use regular small garbage bags for $1.00 per roll of 100 rather than have to search for special bags.I recommend you go for the Diaper Champ you will not be disappointed!!,[]
!,[]
I hate this diaper pail.,[]
I bought it because of the reviews I read.,[]
It worked for six months when he was breastfed only.,[]
But when he started solids it all changed.,[]
It smelled so bad in his room.,[]
The diaper pail must not have a very good seal.,[]
Do not buy this diaper pail.,[]
After reading how great this product was on the convenience of not having to but those expensive bags ( diaper genie) I registered for the diaper champ.,[]
What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.,[]
The smell is HORRIFYING!!!!,[]
Needless to say I am now going to buy the diaper genie and those expensive bags.,[]
I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.,[]
"I strongly recommend that you DON""T buy the diaper CHUMP......",[]
This pail is  by far the best!,[]
"Great price, no special bags, high capacity, easy to use and most importantly...no odor!",[]
"Works well as diaper pail, but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.",[]
"No mess, no smell.",[]
"Very easy to replace garbage bags, you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift, and was very skeptical about it at first.",[]
(It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).,[]
That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.,[]
Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.,[]
We chose this diaper pail based on the reviews and we really liked that you can use regular garbage bags instead of paying for specific refills.,[]
The Diaper Champ has met all of our expectations.,[]
I don't think we could have lived without this thing.,[]
It definitely contains the odor but you do have to spray it with some disinfectant over time since diaper smells can be overpowering.,[]
This is so easy to use also with just a flip and the diaper is gone.,[]
I found this to be much better than the Diaper Genie which was used by some of my friends.,[]
"Over time, they just stopped using it because it was too much of a hassle and costly with the specific refills.",[]
I'm certain we'll continue to use this as long as my baby is in diapers.,[]
I initially planned to get a Diaper Genie.,[]
I opted not to because of the expensive refill bags.,[]
I'm glad I didn't buy it.,[]
We live in an apartment and have the Champ set up in his bedroom.,[]
I don't smell any odors unless I open the Champ up to change the bag....which is expected when you have a bag filled with wet and soiled diapers.,[]
"We use scented Glad bags to help mask the odor, which helps.",[]
"I don't know how it will perform when I switch my son to formula and when he starts solids, so I give the Champ 4 stars.",[]
I'll probably just put the wet diapers in it and take the soiled ones out to the garbage can.,[]
I would definately recommend this diaper pail to my friends.,[]
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.,[]
"Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?",[]
"I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.",[]
"I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, ""Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?",[]

"For my shower, I received the Diaper Genie which I had registered for.",[]
My sister had one and it received so many &quot;awards&quot; in different baby magazines.,[]
I used it for three months and hated it.,[]
You could smell odors as soon as you entered my daughter's room.,[]
"During the summer, if a fly got into the apartment, it would be easy to find him sitting on the Diaper Genie!",[]
"In mid July, I purchased the Diaper Champ after reading the good reviews and I like it much better.",[]
It is much easier to dispose of the diapers (one hand).,[]
I don't notice any odors unless I get really close to it; and of course when I empty it.,[]
I use scented bags and I placed a Stick-Up inside.,[]
I empty it on average once a week (shake it a bit if the diapers stack in the middle).,[]
"Once I take the bag out, I spray the inside and both sides of the &quot;cup&quot; with Lysol and let it air out and dry for about thirty minutes.",[]
"(However, last week I tried the Clorox disinfecting spray which worked even better!)",[]
I have cleaned it without any problems-but I haven't had to take it apart.,[]
"I make sure all diapers are wrapped tight, and if there is a really messy one, I put in in a grocery bag first before putting it in the Champ.",[]
"The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.",[]
I would recommend the Diaper Champ to everyone.,[]
I have had this product since the birth of my first child 30 months ago.,[]
"I had started to notice a smell coming through, so I decided to buy a new diaper pail.",[]
"(I also have an 18 month old, and a 3 month old) I went out and bought the Safety 1st - 'neat!'.",[]
"It keeps smells out, but it wastes a lot of the refill pack.",[]
"Everytime I emptied it, there was twice as much bag as there was dirty diapers.",[]
I returned it and bought a second diaper champ!,[]
I will never change again!!,[]
!,[]
this thing is awesome!,[]
way better than a waste basket!,[]
you can't even smell all the stink when the lid's on!,[]
this is the best thing that ever happened to my bathroom!,[]
I LOOOVE this diaper pail!,[]
Its the easiest to use!,[]
after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.,[]
I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!,[]
"No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!",[]
And it holds alot more!,[]
I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.,[]
This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!,[]
I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them!,[]
and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.,[]
"Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!",[]
And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.,[]
"It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!",[]
I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!,[]
!,[]
I would recommend this over any diaper pail system!,[]
I was to cheap to buy the Diaper Genie b/c of the refill bags but I knew I would need a diaper pail with a lid.,[]
I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!,[]
My child is now 9 months and it still is working even now that their diapers really smell bad.When ever I see another Diaper pail on a friends registry I suggest them changing it!THE DIAPER CHAMP IS A GREAT BUY!!,[]
!,[]
My husband and I love this.,[]
It does a great job of containing those smelly diapers.,[]
"Love that I never get caught without bags, since it uses ordinary kitchen bags.",[]
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I do ocassionally chip a nail opening it up!,[]
;-),[]
We ordered the Diaper Champ because (unlike the Diaper Genie) it took regular bags and was easier to use with one hand.,[]
"Both are true, and we like those features.",[]
"There are, however,  some downsides we've discovered.",[]
"First off, it doesn't hold much--we have to empty it every other day.",[]
"Second (and most important), it's not 100% odor free.",[]
You can absolutely smell a hint of &quot;diaper scent&quot; from 3 feet away.,[]
"We'll keep it and use it, but we're hardly thrilled.",[]
"If a 3rd option hits the market, it might prove better.",[]
I received the Diaper Champ as a gift when my baby girl was born last year.,[]
At first it seemed as the perfect way to keep diaper smells away; it worked like a charm.,[]
"Within four to five months it started to smell, it did not seal properly and the smell got impregnated on the plastic, it was impossible to get rid of it.",[]
"I tried to wash it, spray it, scrub it, but nothing.",[]
Maybe the sealing system fades with use.,[]
I used it till I couldn't anymore and two months ago bought the Diaper Genie.,[]
"Yes, you have to buy refils ... it does a great job a sealing smells.",[]
My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.,[]
"For their last child they used another brand, and  were dissatisfied.",[]
"However, they love the Diaper Champ.",[]
Bought this on amazon.,[]
Never saw it around.,[]
Went through 3 kids.,[]
Very well madeNever would smell poopy diapers.,[]
"Just use a store plastic bag and then when it's full, justThrow away.",[]
Love it !,[]
The Diaper Champ is TERRIBLE at keeping the smelly diapers from only smelling in the container.,[]
"Our baby's room was constantly stinky (due to the Diaper Champ, not the baby!",[]
"), and we were having to empty the container almost daily.",[]
What's the point of having a diaper disposal system if you can't dispose of diapers efficiently?,[]
Please don't buy this product unless you enjoy smelling those dirty diapers.,[]
The Diaper Champ just doesn't work.,[]
"This item was purchased for my son who was born Dec. By the time it started getting warm, that's when the smells began.",[]
Only got worse as summer came around.,[]
I would sorta recommend.,[]
I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.,[]
"I would recommend b/c of price, no refill for bags etc.",[]
Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.,[]
"Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.",[]
I recommend just throwing the diaper in your regular trash.,[]
And take the poopies outside.,[]
THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,[]
This has been a life saver for my husband and I.,[]
"My son has some REALLY stinky diapers, and w/ the diaper champ all we have lift out the bag.",[]
"Best of all, there is no odor!!!",[]
The best thing is that it uses regular trash bags.,[]
This has made diaper changing so much easier.,[]
"We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.",[]
"If you are a new mom, this is the best diaper pail on the market.",[]
I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.,[]
"I thought Baby Trend would have a simple solution for this - a replacement rubber ring, but no.",[]
"They won't even return my 3 messages and one email and every time I call the customer service number to speak to a real live human, no one answsers.",[]
No one.,[]
I purchased this diaper disposal system with gift cards I received at my baby shower and was so excited at the idea of an alternative to the &quot;special bags&quot; disposal systems.,[]
Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.,[]
I have more than one child and seeing a toddler running through the house with a piece to the diaper pail in their mouth is enough to turn your stomach.,[]
"Besides the unsanitary aspect of that, it is a safety issue.",[]
My husband and I both have tried to get it to stay in permanently to no avail.,[]
I also am not too thrilled with the fact that anything besides diapers will get caught in the flip mechanism and be stuck there.,[]
I really wish I had just stuck with the Diaper Genie and will probably go out and purchase it anyway.,[]
I am NOT a happy customer!,[]
"Our Diaper Champ worked well for about 14 months-then the handle well, for lack of a better word, broke off.",[]
"Also, the smell does get bad even when you clean it regularly.",[]
"Nice to have, but not a must-have.",[]
My son is four months and this product is perfect.,[]
No smells at all!,[]
"Holds a decent amount of diapers, my husband empties it once a week.",[]
"No down side, all pluses here!",[]
Especially no special bags to buy.,[]
"And when your child is out of diapers, you can use it as a regular trash can to put food or pet waste in.",[]
This is a great item.,[]
We bought it because we liked that no special bags were required.,[]
"Our son is three months old, and has more than his share of wet and dirty diapers, we only have to change it once every 5-6 days.",[]
"We have never had to change it because it smells, only because it is full.",[]
*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!,[]
The diaper champ is an essential part of a nursery.,[]
I love this thing.,[]
"I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.",[]
"You do have to ""package"" the diaper like a present so the contents don't get out - but I think any parent would realize that you don't stick a dirty diaper sloppily into anything without asking for some trouble.",[]
I anti-bacterialize it every few weeks and it looks as clean as the day I got it and I've been using it for 4 months now.The ONLY drawback I found is that I wish it were taller so I could use the full potential of the garbage bags.,[]
That's why I gave it 4 stars.,[]
It's a little short so the garbage bags don't get really full.,[]
The huge plus to this is that you can use any garbage bag and not have to buy those special ones and waste money like other models.,[]
"Overall, great price, great odor control and keeps nursery clean and smelling fresh.",[]
"It appears that I may be the only person who has anything negative to say about this diaper dumpster, but after using it for 15 months we have decided to replace it with another device.Simply put, their is a foam ring that separates the dumpster from the lid, after many turns of the lid, the foam fell out and the odor leaked out into the room.","[('foam', 0.16199781681251657)]"
"Yuck!Another problem with this pale is the use of ordinary trash bags; although they are cheap, they are less effective than large 2 handled bags.",[]
"These bags cost $5 for 20 bags, each bag lasts 1 week (aprox.",[]
"25 to 30 diapers) and when you need to change the bag, look out, the smell will nock you on your butt!",[]
"Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.",[]
"Take it from someone who has lived with the champ and another, you may be penny wise buy saving on bags, but pound foolish for its pension to fall apart and the weekly odor you are exposed to.",[]
"We researched all of the different types of diaper pails, including the Diaper Genie which some of our friends have, but this one takes the cake.",[]
"Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.",[]
"Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.",[]
"When you are done, just pull the handle from one side to the other, and presto, you're done.",[]
"It holds around 15-20 diapers (I have changed it probably twice a week), and you just open it, tie the bag and take it out.",[]
"To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!",[]
I highly recommend that.,[]
"And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.",[]
I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.,[]
You don't need the Genie.,[]
"My best friend has one, and not only does it stink (literally), the whole ""special bag"" thing irks me.",[]
Give this guy a try.,[]
I am so glad we did!,[]
"I work at a store that sells Diaper genies, and they are ALWAYS being returned due to people unable to use them, they were so complicated.",[]
So I knew I did not want that.,[]
I went with the diaper champ and I love it!,[]
"So easy to use, I can use kitchen bags that I already have as liners and no odor!!",[]
I can't belive some of the negative reviews.,[]
Our daughter is 14 months old and we have used this since day one.,[]
To the reviewer who said wipes get stuck...WRAP THEM IN THE DIRTY DIAPER.,[]
You should do that no matter what diaper system you have.,[]
I wouldn't trade this for any other system!!,[]
!,[]
"Clean, economical, simple.",[]
"Never experienced any odor ""problems""; we just empty the receptacle every other day.",[]
I laughed when my husband wanted this product.,[]
I felt it was  a waste of money and that you could just throw the diapers in the garage.,[]
Well thats not a good idea.,[]
We have the diaper champ and never smell anything.,[]
This is a great item that every parent needs.,[]
"Its easy to use, and you can use your own bags.",[]
"We actually use kitchen bags, and they hold quite a few diapers.",[]
We only have to change the bag out about once a week.,[]
I can't say enough great things about the diaper champ.,[]
I initially requested the diaper genie for my baby shower.,[]
"I had a ton of people recommend the diaper champ over the genie, but I figured it had a bigger name at the time.... WHAT A MISTAKE!!",[]
!This diaper holder is PERFECT!!!,[]
"It uses ANY bags around, doesn't let any smell leak out and is so easy it can be operated with one hand.",[]
I am so glad that I bought it!!!,[]
I will use the same one for future children.,[]
It has taken a beating and is still working strong!!,[]
!,[]
The diaper champ is a winner.,[]
Amazingly the odors do disappear when you flip the handle.,[]
"We have not,nor has anyone else that has been in our home or the baby's room noticed any foul smells.The fact that you use regular kitchen bags is a huge cost savings.And it is SO SIMPLE to use, no cranking and no twisting.",[]
"Just a simple ""flip"".",[]
"Living in small quarters with two ""productive"" cats, we were desperate.",[]
"My daughter, who has 6 kids (3 in diapers) recommended this product, and we love it.",[]
"It's easy to use, discreet, and, best of all, EFFECTIVE at controlling odor for up to a week.",[]
"We simply scoop the litter into a grocery bag, dispose of it in the Diaper Champ, and at the end of the week, we take the whole thing to the garbage.",[]
THANK YOU THANK YOU for this great product.,[]
"I agree with all of those who said this product is easy to use, it is.",[]
"It is also very good at keeping little hands out of the dirty diapers.What I have found though is that when a stinky diaper is deposited, the room smells until I change the bag out.",[]
"One thing that I have done is when I am going to deposit a poopy diaper is to place an empty plastic bag into the tube area, put the diaper in it, and then tie that bag off before turning the champ handle, thus adding another layer of stink prevention.",[]
"It isn't perfect, but it helps.",[]
"I like the idea of trying scented garbage bags, so may give that a whirl too.I wanted to write a review so that people don't buy this and think that it solves ALL of their diaper problems.",[]
"I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.",[]
"This pail might be fine for disposables, but it's a pain if you're using cloth diapers and a service.",[]
"It's really hard to keep clean (it gets pretty disgusting), it doesn't hold a whole week of diapers, the diapers fall in the middle and don't distribute evenly so it seems full before it is, and now that we're at the second size up (my baby's 5 months old) the diapers barely fit in the hole.",[]
"I often end up just opening it completely and putting the diapers in underneath, bypassing the so-called handy one-hand flip method completely.",[]
I hate the thing.,[]
I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.,[]
I'd never recommend it to anyone using cloth!,[]
I have now had my Diaper Champ for 4 days and I couldn't be happier.,[]
I had the Diaper Genie before and it is nothing compared to this.,[]
I even ended up throwing my diaper genie out and looking for a new way to dispose of my son's diapers when I found the Diaper Champ.,[]
My son even got sick when I got my Diaper Champ and had some pretty horrible diapers and I cannot smell a thing in his room.,[]
It is incredibly simple to use and I love that I no longer have to buy any expensive refills and can use plain old kitchen trash bags.,[]
Simply love it!,[]
!,[]
"I like the fact that you don't have to purchase brand-name insert for this product, but can use any garbage bag.",[]
"I have to say, though, that after my daughter started solids, the odor control has not been great unless the bag is changed frequently.",[]
We have loved our diaper champ.,[]
"However, now that my son is 14 months old, we are going to have to buy another one because his is starting to smell.",[]
We were pleased that it kept smells out for this long.,[]
You cannot imagine how much money you'll save and it doesn't smell AT ALL!!!,[]
You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag.,[]
IT'S WONDERFULL!!,[]
!,[]
I bought this trying to save a few dollars and when I received it I thought it felt and looked real junky.,[]
After using it for over a week I have to admit I was wrong.,[]
I have 2 babies in diapers and the Diaper Champ keeps their room smelling GREAT.,[]
"It is extremely easy to use and it has the added advantage that one can use ANY plastic bag with the Champ.It is an all around great, helpful and inexpensive product.",[]
My daughter is 2 and half months old and I have been very pleased with the diaper champ.,[]
As with anything that you stick trash in once it is full there may be a slight odor.,[]
I put a little bit of baking soda in the bottom of mine to help eliminate any odor.,[]
I only notice an odor when its full.,[]
I then empty it and that remedies the problem.,[]
I really like that you can use a houshold trash bag with the diaper champ.,[]
It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item.,[]
I would buy another one and recommend it to anyone.,[]
We have been using the diaper champ for five months now and our son was born a pretty big baby (nine pounds)!!!,[]
"We have had no problems with it, its easy to wipe down with bleach or whatever you use to clean with.",[]
You just put a bag in and there you go.. of course there is a slight smell from the champ but only after a few days (I change mine every three days or so) the diapers fit pretty good in the hole and the only problem I have is opening the lid sometimes can snap when you open it but other than that its been really great...,[]
I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it.,[]
I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts!,[]
(no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant.,[]
"His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week, every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week.",[]
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.,[]
"They've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned...if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do, and you get poop on the pail, it does need to be wiped off.",[]
"A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe, every week or two doesn't hurt either.",[]
"Although the idea of not spending money on a pricey canister with refills may seem tempting, for my next child I am tossing this Diaper Champ and buying another brand.",[]
"I have to keep it out in the garage, that's how bad it smells.",[]
"Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$.",[]
Keep Looking.,[]
This diaper pail - plain and simple - does NOT stink!,[]
"I purchased it when I was expecting our 5th child, and it was kept in our bedroom for a few months while our daughter slept in our room in a bassinet.",[]
Not once did I ever detect an odor coming from the diaper pail!,[]
And now that she is 10 months old (and her diapers hold more significant contents!,[]
)there is still no odor problem!,[]
"The baby shares a room with her 6 1/2 year old sister, and her sister has never complained about a smell (and it is situated right next to her dollhouse!",[]
)I wish I'd had this YEARS ago!,[]
"I totally agree with Reviewer:  ""aixela119"".",[]
She took the words out of my mouth.,[]
No diaper pail will cover up all the stink from the really nasty diaper changes.,[]
Those get walked right into the garage!The best thing is that it takes normal trash bags.,[]
No extra bags that cost alot.,[]
My husband and I loved this and we're planning on using it for number 2.,[]
I did a lot of research before I bought a diaper pail and this is what I ended up with.,[]
Boy am I glad I did!,[]
the handle is very easy to flip even with a baby in hand.,[]
"We use the inexpensive, scented garbage bags in the pail and they seem to work very well.",[]
We do have to change the bag about 2 times a week but it is all worth it from the horror stories I have heard from owners of the &quot;other&quot; pail.,[]
There is no smell at this point but I am told that some sort of smell is inevitable whenever she starts on solids.,[]
All in all it is worth the money!,[]
This works great.,[]
Sometimes diapers get a little stuck.,[]
I find giving it a good jiggle and emptying it once a week does the trick.,[]
"You can use any garbage bags, and it keeps odor sealed in!",[]
We love it!,[]
"As a Mother of 9 month old twins, I go through plenty of diapers.",[]
"We're moving to the U.K. in a couple of weeks, and after not being able to find a 'Champ' anywhere overseas, I'm having one shipped to our new home.",[]
"We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.",[]
I highly recommend this product to anyone!,[]
"I wanted this diaper pail over the Genie b/c I liked the idea of being able to use standard trash bags instead of special refills, plus I have NEVER been able to get a Diaper Genie to easily work!",[]
"Now that I have the Champ, I'm glad I got it, because it's very easy to use, however there are a few things I don't like about it:1.",[]
It's hard to get the lid open...I've broken several nails and hurt my hand trying to pop the latch open.2.,[]
"Because of the funky ring on the inside that I haven't yet determined the purpose of, the diapers get clogged near the top so that the handle can't be turned.",[]
"There is generally more than enough room left in the trash bag, so in order to avoid changing a bag that is only a third of the way full, I have to open the lid and adjust the pile of diapers or rock the pail back and forth so the diapers fall and I can continue filling.3.",[]
A diaper got jammed in it once when the sticky tab stuck to the foam seal in the plunger.,[]
The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.,[]
"The pail still works fine, but now the plunger is loose so it bangs around when you turn the handle, which makes more noise than before.4.",[]
"I have noticed a smell on occasion, but I expected as much...it's a plastic can full of poop...it's not going to smell like roses!",[]
!,[]
I love my diaper champ.,[]
No need to buy special bags like the diaper genie.,[]
"I've only been using the Diaper Champ for 9 weeks, but really, is there an expiration date?",[]
So far the thing has only SAVED OUR LIVES!,[]
I remember the smells that came out of the diaper pail my mother used for my sisters...there was a very good reason for keeping it in the basement.,[]
It should have been entombed in an egyptian catacomb!,[]
"We keep this one right in the living room, next to the baby's bassinet.",[]
"This is the room where we eat, breathe, whatever.",[]
We have yet to smell a thing!Whoever figured out this design is a genius.,[]
I highly reccomend this product to anyone...everyone!,[]
This is THE BEST diaper pail we've had.,[]
"The Genie was a pain, with all the twisting and the special bags refills.",[]
"This locks the odor in the pail, is easy to use one-handed, and a favorite for babysitters and guests.",[]
"I've recommended it to many, and all have loved it!",[]
"We found it easy to replace the bags, and to put in a dirty diaper.",[]
I don't know why people have had problems with it.,[]
It couldn't be easier!,[]
I LOVE this product.,[]
My sister (mother of 2) recommended this to me and I am so grateful.,[]
It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!,[]
This is a must have for any new parent!,[]
I have a diaper champ and have used the diaper genie and another similar diaper container.,[]
"The only drawback I found to the diaper champ is that I use cloth diapers and as the diaper sizes got bigger, I had to actually open the pail to put them in rather then use the flip top feature because the cloth diapers were too big for the opening.",[]
If you use disposables this is a great pail as you can use any garbage bag to line it and it does keep ALL odors away.,[]
"I love the fact that you don't need a specific bag, and a cheap garbage bag is enough.",[]
But it doesn't keep smells in at all.,[]
"I didn't realize I was buying a large one either, so even though it's far from full you have to take the gab out.",[]
But it's just the nature of garbage.,[]
"It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.",[]
"At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!",[]
It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.,[]
"I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.",[]
"The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.",[]
Smells terrible and always jams up!!!,[]
We could smell the dirty diapers as soon as you walk in the babys room.,[]
"Also, the diaper ""chute"" would jam up all the time, you would have to slam it to get the diapers loose.",[]
I'm trying the Diaper Genie ...wish me luck!,[]
"The Diaper Champ is great in that you can use your regular kitchen garbage bags, and it has a good capacity so it doesn't fill up too quickly.",[]
"With especially stinky diapers, we find that bagging them (grocery bag or ziplock) before throwing away is necessary to truly keep the odor at bay.",[]
"This is one of the items that I absolutely love, something I'd rather not live without.",[]
The only time I've ever noticed a smell is when you leave the poopy diapers in the pail too long.Love it!,[]
We started out with a diaper genie which almost caused us to get a divorce!,[]
"It was impossible to use, every time my husband would get it working right, I'd put a diaper in and ruin it.",[]
We bought the champ when our baby was about 4 weeks old and my husband and I agree it is by far the greatest baby item we bought!,[]
It is so easy to use and empty and really controls the diaper smell.,[]
Everyone compliments us on how much our house doesn't smell like dirty diapers  ;-) Even now that our son is in size 4 diapers it still handles the daiper just fine.,[]
We love it!,[]
!,[]
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!,[]
MY HUSBAND AND I CHOSE TO USE CLOTH DIAPERS ON OUR SON AND THIS WORKS GREAT FOR HOLDING THEM UNTIL THEY GET WASHED.,[]
WE NEVER NOTICE A SMELL COMING FROM IT.,[]
WE ALSO LOVE THAT IT USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS RATHER THAN NEEDING SPECIAL BAGS.,[]
IT HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR US AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS CLOTH DIAPERING THEIR BABY.,[]
This diaper champ is a great product.,[]
"I have seen reviews where people say they have an oder problem, well I change mine every few days and have had no oder problems.",[]
I really like the fact that I can use any bag I want.,[]
I would definatly reccomend this product to afriend.,[]
"This product worked for a while, but it doesn't last.",[]
Shortly after our daughter turned one: the outer material on the piece that covers the opening and covers the smell began to wear off; which in turn does not provide a tight seal and makes this product useless.,[]
"we used the product correctly and cleaned it, and now we are forced to go buy something else.",[]
The other positive reviews that are written refer to kids well under one.,[]
We registered for the diaper champ mostly based on the reviews and the fact that no special bags were needed.,[]
I am very impressed with how easy it is to change the bag and I have not had any problems with smells.,[]
We use the odor guard trash bags but I doubt it has much effect (it doesn't in the kitchen anyway).,[]
The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.,[]
Would definitely recommend,[]
I like some features of the Diaper Champ.,[]
I do not find that it is odorless at all.,[]
I do like the one-handed operation of it.,[]
"However, my toddler is constantly putting things in it and I have to paw through the dirty diapers to see what he's thrown away before I dispose of the bag.",[]
"Using regular trash bags is nice, but I think there is something to be said for scented liners.",[]
"THis is the only one I have ever used, and i have to say I LIKE IT!",[]
"It is easy to use, i just put in a white trash bag and dumped the diaper down the shute.",[]
"It holds a ton of daipers, and the smell is not bad at all.",[]
"I did notice now that my daughter is 15 months her poop is stonger and i dont put those in there, due to the smell.",[]
But diapers with pee only do not smell at all.,[]
The only bad thing is you need to ensure you dont get #2 on the shute or if you do it will stick there.,[]
"It is really easy to use, and doesn't take up a lot of space.",[]
I thought the Diaper Champ was the best thing ever...for the first 6 months.,[]
I loved it so much I bought two.,[]
"Too bad after 6 months, I would go into my son's room and think he had pooped, but no..it was just the Champ.",[]
My living room one also smelled disguisting.,[]
My sister-in-law and two friends have encountered the same.,[]
We all bought them on each other's recommendations because it was easy and we did not have to buy special bags.,[]
"Well, we were the suckers because we have all gone back to the Diaper Genie or the regular trash.",[]
Do not make the mistake we did.,[]
"The editor mentions an order here and there but believe me, it is much more than that.",[]
It is embarassing.,[]
"I have never commented on a product, but I would hate for someone else to go through this.",[]
"For some reason, Amazon first sent us this product used...complete with poop stains!",[]
We were very disappointed but they redeemed themselves by sending us a brand new one.,[]
Now we are very happy with it.,[]
I absolutely loved our diaper champ up until now.,[]
I loved just using trash bags.,[]
It is very easy to deposit the diapers with one hand.,[]
"And, it never had an odor.",[]
Until now.,[]
My son is 20 months old and over the past 2 months we have started to notice a slight odor.,[]
The seal around the piston isn't in the correct place anymore and I think that is why it smells.,[]
"However, I am going to buy another one after reading all the reviews on the Diaper Genie and the Neat system.",[]
I have issues with paying for refills when trash bags are much cheaper!,[]
"Not to mention, I really liked it up until now.",[]
"With our second child on the way, I'm still a supporter of the Champ!",[]
We registered for this item because of the convience of the trash bags.,[]
We are now finally giving up on this item and purchasing the diaper genie.,[]
"We changed the bags several times a week, bleached the pail regularly and used the odor control disks.",[]
Nothing works!,[]
"On top of this, the foam seal came unglued and twisted making it usless and of course even more odorful.",[]
"When you end up taking each of the diapers outside to the trash as they come, the point of having a diaper pail is diminished greatly and I would rather spend the money on the special bags.",[]
"Needless to say, it was a waste of money since we are now going to by the other brand anyway.",[]
We gave away our Diaper Genie and bought 2 of these when our second child was born.,[]
You use regular garbage bags and it takes less than a minute to change.,[]
No bad smells - no expensive liners.,[]
LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,[]
!,[]
We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost 5 months now and love it.,[]
It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay.,[]
I would recommend hosing the inside with Lysol after each bag change.,[]
We use it with ordinary trash bags and it works great.,[]
No smell!,[]
Great product!,[]
"I don't know if the people who've reviewed this item before me work for the manufacturer or something, but I DO NOT recommend this.",[]
"I owned a Diaper Genie for a year, before needing to buy a replacement (as my one year old snapped the lid off).",[]
"I read the reviews of this, the Diaper Champ, and thought ""Great!"".",[]
"So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.",[]
"After two months of using this product, I can say that I recommend the Diaper Genie over this one, 100% !Yes, refills cost money for the Genie.",[]
"But when using regular kitchen bags for this product, I find it extremely wasteful, as the Champ only fills half the bag before it becomes full inside and needs to be replaced.",[]
"Also, the smell is disgusting when changing the bags!",[]
"THIS IS NOT STINK-PROOF - and smells, by far, worse then my Genie ever did!",[]
We even used scented bags and it didn't help.,[]
"This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.",[]
"Yes, if you're careful you can avoid this 99% of the time.",[]
But it's still quite disgusting when it does happen.,[]
It's not that much easier to use than the Genie either.,[]
"Like stated for this product, you can also use the Genie with one hand.",[]
"It doesn't hold very much before it becomes full - less than a week for newborn size diapers, and it needs to be emptied at least 3 times a week for my older son's size 5 diapers.",[]
"Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.","[('bag', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"He could never do this with the Genie because of its' closeable lid.Overall, I don't recommend this product over the Diaper Genie.",[]
This is an overall horrible product.,[]
"We've only owned this for 2 months, and when my husband and I are moving in the next few weeks, we will be using that opportunity to put these out with the trash and get new Genies!",[]
The Diaper Champ is a life saver.,[]
We have had no problems with odor at all as some other reviewers have complained of.,[]
We empty it out about 2 times per week and only when we open the lid to take the trash bag out do we smell anything.,[]
"Once it's sealed shut, no stench whatsoever.",[]
"No complaints about the Diaper Champ, especially since it is so easy on the pocket-book compared to the rest of the diaper pails out there.",[]
I was a Diaper Champ devotee until my child turned 15 months.,[]
I loved the fact that I didn't have to buy the expensive refill packs and no problems with smell.,[]
I was patting myself on the back for a good informed purchase.,[]
Then suddenly my sweet baby turned into a toddler.,[]
"Although he's been on solids since 6 months, inexplicably his poops started stinking to high heaven!!",[]
"Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!",[]
"The Diaper Champ, which was fine for the breastfed infant, just didn't do the trick for my 15 month old.",[]
I would put a stinky diaper and immediately the smell permeated the whole house!,[]
I had to change bags after every stinky dipe!,[]
I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.,[]
"Believe me, you'll pay any price for a refill if your house reeks.",[]
I am hanging on to my Diaper Champ only because I hope to have another baby next year and I expect to have 2 in diapers for a while.,[]
I will use it with infant diapers only.,[]
Be warned!,[]
The Diaper Champ will suffice for infants but not toddlers!,[]
"If I had to do again, I would have opted for the Genie.",[]
I was very sceptical with purchasing this at first.,[]
"Somehow I couldn't believe this would block odors and the childs room would always smell, but we've had this for a few weeks now and there's NO SMELL at all!!!",[]
We're very happy.,[]
"We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.",[]
"That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!",[]
Even when empty!,[]
"So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.",[]
It still smelled.,[]
So then I used straight bleach.,[]
That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.,[]
Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.,[]
"However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.",[]
"The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.",[]
"Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.",[]
"Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.",[]
Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.,[]
"My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it (Being a diaper pail, I'd prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary.)",[]
I have a four month old baby boy and my husband and I just love the Diaper Champ!,[]
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.,[]
It is so easy to use and doesn't let the odors out (until you go to change the bag of course - but big deal that takes only a few seconds to do anyway).,[]
I recommend it to all my expecting friends.,[]
I'm glad my husband brought this home instead of a third try at the ever popular but difficult to use diaper genie!,[]
"I bought two of these (one upstairs, one downstairs).",[]
It keeps the smell at bay pretty well and is very easy to use.,[]
I highly recommend this.,[]
"Plus, you don't have to buy the bags for it - just use your own trashbags!",[]
Wow!,[]
This is fabulous.,[]
"It was a toss-up between the Diaper Genie and this one, and we decided on the Diaper Champ since you didn't need refill bags to go with it.",[]
"I go through a TON of diapers a day (I have twins) and instead of making a hundred trips to the trash can in the garage to get the poopie stink out of the house, I use this...and it works!",[]
Absolutely no smell escapes from the Diaper Champ and I can use plain kitchen garbage bags in it.,[]
We're very pleased with ours.,[]
"Spend the extra five dollars on this diaper disposer rather than settle for the ""Genie"".",[]
I have a friend that had the Diaper Genie and complained of it smelling on occasion.,[]
"My husband and I were a little leary of purchasing a diaper pail, but decided to give the Diaper Champ a try!",[]
I am so glad that we did!,[]
We have been using it for almost a month and it is great!,[]
"It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!",[]
I would definetely recommend!,[]
"We purchased this diaper pail after trying the ""odorless"" pail for $14 and the ""Diaper Genie"" (second hand)for $5.",[]
"I was VERY disappointed with the performance and smell of the odorless pail, and VERY suprised at the cost$$ of the refills for the diaper genie besides it's difficulty to use (no directions).",[]
"I had wanted & registed for the ""Diaper Genie"" but only got it AFTER using the others.",[]
It was well worth the investment!!!,[]
I love the fact that I can use regular trash bags (I reccomend the scented ones) so it is cheep enough to change frequently (2-3 times weekly) which helps minimize the odor.,[]
"I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.",[]
"If you ""package"" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.",[]
I also reccomend buying the cheap hanging car air fresheners to hand inside (over the handle) for extra conrol (cheeper than stick ups or the scent disks).,[]
"Don't forget to change the bag frequently, don't fill too full or it will be difficult to turn, occationally spary with disinfectant & let it air out to keep the plastic from absorbing any odors itself (I do it while we are gone for the day).",[]
"We are now expecting our second child and will continue to use this pail, we LOVE it!",[]
!,[]
This was the best diaper pail that I have had yet.,[]
"I tried the diaper genie and a couple others, but this one held the odor at bay, my youngest child is now two and it was the best thing we ever found.",[]
We liked this diaper pail because it uses regular trash bags.,[]
"It definatly keeps the smell contained, but, it will only hold about 15 to 20 dirty diapers before it gets clogged up.",[]
"When it is full, the lid won't turn over without some force.",[]
This is a minor annoyance and it just needs to be emptied more often.,[]
I had the Diaper Genie with my first child who is now 20 months.,[]
"We have a second on the way, due in July and wanted something different since the DG was smelling, even though I deodorized it weekly.",[]
I was shopping at Babies R Us with my daughter and took her to the restroom to change her.,[]
"Inside they had the Diaper Champ and I liked it right away, so I added it to my registry while there.",[]
Someone bought the DC for us very quickly and it was horrible!,[]
"Even thought we wad the dirty diapers up very tight, they always got stuck inside the inner ring of the DC, ripping the dirty diapers to shreds inside, so the smell is awful!",[]
"Granted my daughters' diapers are bigger than our newborns would be, but if we had that problem now, what makes me think that it wouldn't jam as our son got into larger sized diapers?!?",[]
We took it back and got the diaper genie again.,[]
Very glad we did.,[]
Baby Trend Diaper Champ.,[]
The product received appeared to be used.,[]
Came in an old and beat up box.,[]
The inside drum was too big for the pail and they obviously did not go together as a unit.,[]
"After receiving the item, my daughter went back and read the reviews for this seller and it appears that this is a trend.",[]
Sounds almost as if they seller  continues to send the same product in hopes someone will keep it.,[]
I have never had any trouble with anything that I bought on line at Amazon.,[]
com.,[]
I did email the seller and they told me to take it to UPS and send it back.,[]
"They didn't offer to replace it, just said they would do a refund when they received the product back.",[]
"Quick response from seller, we'll see how quick the refund.",[]
Read Reviews on sellers BEFORE you buy.,[]
I loved the Diaper Champ up until my son turned about 8 months old and was on solids for a couple of months.,[]
"I never had a problem with odors until then and love the fact that you don't have to buy special bags, etc.",[]
"At about 8 months, my baby's room just started to stink if we had a dirty (poopy) diaper in there.",[]
"We still use the Diaper Champ, but if we have poopy diapers, we just dump the poop in the toliet, then dispose of the diaper.",[]
"If we happen to come across an especially stinky diaper and put it in the Diaper Champ, we need to empty it (regardless of if its full or not) and put a fresh bag in.",[]
It still is a nice diaper pail and is definately worth the money.,[]
"I guess once you start feeding your baby food other than breast milk, it's inevitable that the diapers will be pretty stinky!",[]
"It's true, it does not work as well as the diaper genie.",[]
I am going back to that.,[]
"I have used both and I can assure you, this product does not contain smells - I even put it in the closet, and still we smell it!",[]
Save yourself the money.,[]
I received this 2 1/2 weeks ago as a gift from my registry a couple days after I came home from the hospital.,[]
What a great little contraption!,[]
For me it holds a week's worth of dirty diapers (small size)..just in time to get out to the trash!,[]
I used the diaper genie with my other children--what a pain in the neck that was.,[]
I have had no problems with it whatsoever--it is very easy to use.,[]
I would highly recommend this product.,[]
I chose this pail because I didn't want to spend alot on a daiper pail.,[]
"In the end, I spent more because I had to buy a different one.",[]
"After only a few months of using it, the seal broke and  the odor came through.",[]
The latch would get stuck making it difficult to change the bag.,[]
This is certainly not worth buying!,[]
!,[]
I have the Diaper Champ from day one and my baby is now 9 months old.,[]
I don't have any problem with odor.,[]
"Of course, you have to clean it once in a while (maybe once every week or 2), well, it's a garbage disposal!",[]
What do you expect?,[]
"Honestly, I rarely even clean it.",[]
"It's easy to use (no turning and changing of liners), easy to clean, much cheaper than the Diaper Genie as you can use regular plastic garbage bags, and it is a good size.",[]
"I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.",[]
"Despite that, I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!",[]
The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together!,[]
"The design is simple, yet brilliant, and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed.",[]
Our baby's room never smells!,[]
We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.,[]
"We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!",[]
"The best thing about the Diaper Champ is that you can use regular trash bags, you don't have to purchase special ones.",[]
It also holds a good amount of dirty diapers.,[]
I usually go close to a week before changing the bag.,[]
My son is 14 mos old and we've used this since he was born.,[]
"I do notice some odor problems on occasion, but that comes with the territory.",[]
"Like the last reviewer said, the older the baby gets, the more smelly their diapers become.",[]
"I simply change the bag, get rid of the bad smell, and it's fine.",[]
I love that it's one handed and not hard to use at all.,[]
"It is pretty difficult to open, the latch that you have to grab onto is very tight and hasn't loosened one bit in 14 mos.",[]
I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!,[]
"All in all, this is a very good product and I would definitely recommend it!",[]
We bought the Diaper Champ when my son was born.,[]
I absolutely loved it - at first.,[]
I loved the ease of using it and the fact that we could use regular trash bags.,[]
Very convenient.,[]
I even gave several of these as shower gifts.,[]
"However after only 9-10 months, the thing started making my son's room STINK.",[]
I guess the seal was not working properly anymore (just my opinion).,[]
"I contacted the Baby Trend company to get a replacement - after all, it had only been 9 -10 months.",[]
The company did not back their product!!,[]
"They just said ""We don't do replacements"".",[]
They just said to clean the thing really well.,[]
I ALWAYS cleaned it when I replaced the bags.,[]
But I tried everything they said to do.,[]
Still - STINKY!,[]
"I contacted them again and complained, but again got really no help.",[]
"I was telling a friend of mine (to whom I gave one of these as a gift) about my problem, and she said that hers is doing the same thing.My opinion now - don't buy it.",[]
"It will probably be great at first, but then you will have a stinky room.",[]
It says something to me when the company won't even back their products.,[]
He seemed to like it just fine.,[]
I think it did a pretty good job of containing the diaper odors.,[]
"After using the Diaper Champ while babysitting for a friend, I decided this was the one for me when my baby was due.",[]
She is now five weeks old and I just love the Champ.,[]
"It is the right height, I don't have to bend over to put a diaper in, I can use one hand, and it contains odors (although there really aren't many odors yet as she is breastfed.)",[]
"I love that it uses regular plastic bags, even grocery bags.",[]
"The handle doesn't turn too well when the bag is full, which is fine with me as it indicates it's time for a new bag.",[]
I will recommend the Diaper Champ to all my friends.,[]
"This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.",[]
You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.,[]
This odor absorbing champ even absorbs the odors from those diaper genies down the street...  My one step diaper champ sure beats the 5 steps it takes to twist a diaper in the that genie.,[]
Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is?,[]
"- The CHAMP is icing on the cake - every mommy gets psyched when their boy (or girl) poops because it means everything is working... and when you toss that diaper into the the mini R2D2 unit, you know you did it right... simplicity... ahh...",[]
What a brilliant idea this diaper champ is!,[]
Those who wrote about the bad smell must be doing something wrong.,[]
"I have had it for about two weeks now, after my genie broke, and this thing works great!",[]
"And changing the bag is so easy, I can barely believe it.",[]
"I think this is the greatest diaper pail which uses REGULAR trash bags, not the pricey refills.",[]
I am very glad I went with the positive reviews and bought this pail.,[]
A great buy.,[]
This was great for first 5 months of my baby girl.,[]
But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.,[]
First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.,[]
"Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.",[]
But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?),[]
which can trap the odor better.I am now looking at the diaper genie.,[]
This product is awesome.,[]
"Easy to use, no smell!",[]
The best thing about it is the savings since you are able to use regular trash bags.,[]
This is a great diaper pail!,[]
"Smells aren't a problem, maybe because we empty it often.",[]
I like that is uses my regular garbage bags which I buy in bulk already anyway.,[]
This works ok.,[]
It does tend to get stuck a lot and can smell from time to time (granted...it's holding dirty diapers).,[]
I bought it because I like the fact that you could use a regular garbage bag.,[]
Plus it's a little taller than other models which helps when you're a tall mommy!,[]
"You wont regret buying this product over the Genie, it is odorless and very useful.",[]
Best of all you can use your everyday cheap bags with no extra costs that you wont afford to buy after a while!,[]
"We registered for the Diaper Champ because we liked the fact that it uses regular trash bags, not special refills.",[]
Our feelings for this product deepened even more this weekend after a run-in with the Diaper Genie at my brother's place--the thing was *so* much harder to use!,[]
"With the Diaper Champ, you just place the diaper in the top and flip the lid.",[]
The diapers (and their odors) are well sealed in the main container.,[]
"With the Diaper Genie, we had to open the thing, push the diaper down, twist the ring, then close it and twist the lid again--puh-leeze!",[]
"Lots of our friends swore by the Diaper Genie, but after this incident with it, I decided to post a review for the Diaper Champ and encourage other Moms to go for the better product.",[]
"We looked into the Diaper Geenie, but why would you spend so much money on the refills over time when all you have to do is...take out the trash!",[]
!It kills me to read reviews where people are wanting the kinds of pails so they don't have to take out the trash as often...how long is too long?,[]
We take out the garbage 2 times a week or as needed and even when we have gone for a whole week we don't have any problems with the smell of diapers from this pail!,[]
"Of course common sense applies here.We are members of Costco Wholesale and purchase their &quot;tall kitchen trash bags&quot; and they fit perfectly in this, we have even purchased the Ruffies garbage bags that smell like lavender as our baby got older and her poop got a little smellier...but the bottom line to this is keep the pail clean...even a wipedown with a baby wipe would work, and take out the trash at least once or twice a week!","[('quot', 0.10104755308958321)]"
This is the best pail and we have given them as gifts...worth the money in the end!,[]
"Very easy to use, no smells at all.",[]
No special bags to buy.,[]
An easy decision.,[]
when changing the bags it's easy to pinch your fingers when opening the cover.,[]
it's also stinky.,[]
"there's no barrier from the rotating portion and the diapers so when the diapers get close to the top it can get pretty stinky...yes, change it often and wash it often.",[]
once baby is eating solid food it's tough keeping it from smelling.,[]
"i wipe daily and wash out once a week, and also change the bag at least 2x's a week.",[]
there's got to be something better!,[]
While my daughter (now 10 months) was breastfed this diaper champ was a champ but now that she's on solids and teething.... oh nelly!,[]
"Now I'm in the position of searching for a better, as in ""not so stinky"", diaper pail.",[]
"Even with regular trash (odor absorbing) bag changes and liberal use if Lysol, nothing has helped the stench.",[]
"We had hoped to keep it throughout the diaper changing process, but now we are forced to look for something else.",[]
The best way better than the diaper genie!,[]
No smell!,[]
It lasted till my kid was done with diapers!,[]
I think this should be a staple in every household with a child!,[]
It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.,[]
The fact that you can use regular trash bags is a BIG plus because you don't have to stock up on refill's or run to the store when you realize you don't have anymore.,[]
There is no oder (until you open it up to empty) and it is easy to use..great item!,[]
"After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.",[]
The name fits!,[]
It makes chaging a diaper so much easier.,[]
"NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!",[]
I would highly recommend this to any new moms,[]
Excellent product.,[]
Holds nearly a week of soiled diapers without release of any unpleasant odor.,[]
Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.,[]
Would recommend that others purchase.,[]
I have an 11-month-old baby and purchased the Diaper Champ because of the ability to use regular trash bags and the promise to be odor-free.,[]
"For the first few months, it worked great!",[]
"I had to return the first one, because the seal ripped, but the second one has been fine as far as that goes.It seems that the longer I use it, the worse the smell is.",[]
I have to change the bag at least every other day!,[]
"I have tried stick-ups, sprinkling baby powder in it, spraying it with Lysol, cleaning it out with 409, and nothing seems to help.",[]
"When I change the bag, I have to let the ""Champ"" air out overnight, and then it is gross by the next afternoon.A friend even puts her diapers in the blue disposable bags before inserting them into the Champ, and she has the same problem I do.The refills for the Diaper Genie are a hassle, but that worked a lot better for me with my TWINS six years ago.","[('champ', 0.13912283223233196)]"
"So, it handled double the amount of diapers and still held up for three years without the problems I am having now.",[]
"At first we were thrilled with the Diaper Champ--when our daughter was a newborn it was a lifesaver, and there was never any odor in or around the container.",[]
"We would wipe it down with Clorox Wipes and spray it with Lysol to help disinfect, and that seemed to do the trick.",[]
"Then our daughter started eating solids, and, as parents know, this changed the smell of her dirty diapers.",[]
And suddenly the Diaper Champ was no longer up to the job.,[]
It didn't just smell dirty--it was RANK.,[]
"This was despite frequent cleanings, changing the bags a few times a week, no longer storing soiled diapers in the thing--we'd throw those out right away and just store wet diapers.",[]
"We tried sprays and smell absorbers and old fashioned elbow grease to help it smell better, but NOTHING worked.",[]
It's like the odor seeped into the plastic and wouldn't leave.,[]
"We've switched to a regular old garbage pail, the kind you buy in a kitchen supply store, and that has proven FAR better, and cheaper, than the Diaper Champ.",[]
"We love the Diaper Champ, just wish it could hold more diapers!",[]
"Really, I can't smell anything once the diaper is in there and it's very easy to load and unload.",[]
"Plus, the price can't be beat.",[]
So we have a 2 month old baby girl and use the Diaper Champ.,[]
No real complaints at all.,[]
The smell is negligible.,[]
"And you'll find yourself dropping other trash beyond diapers into this convenient trash can.Now, once your kid is older and eating solid foods, things might start getting stinky.",[]
But I've heard from friends that smell problems are ubiquitous for older kids regardless of the diaper pail.,[]
They put poopy diapers in a plastic grocery store bag and immediately take them out of the house.,[]
Wet diapers are still fine.,[]
"These guys have all sorts of diaper pails, so I don't think that any pail is really much better on that front for older kids.A great aspect of the Diaper Champ is the use of regular trash bags.",[]
Sure it saves money.,[]
But the key is that you don't have to plan ahead to prepare for the onslaught of diapers that your kid will produce.,[]
Suppose that it's 3:00 AM and you've run out (or are running out) of Diaper Genie refills.,[]
You're not going to be happy.,[]
Maybe you run to the 24 hour drug store and pay out the whazoo for a refill.,[]
"But with the Champ, you don't have to worry about that.",[]
"And you'll have lots of things to worry about with a newborn (and LOTS of diapers to change), so a sufficient supply of diaper pail refills is one of the last things that you'll want to think about.",[]
"To avoid inconveniences associated with the prospect of running out of refills, I'd never trade my Diaper Champ for a pail that requires proprietary refills.",[]
I love this product.,[]
"I used cloth for the first 10 months of my daughter's life, then went to disposable.",[]
I found that the garbage pail just wasn't gonna cut it when it came to disposing of her diapers.,[]
"I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.",[]
Put a dang stick up deoderizer in this thing and call it good people!,[]
"Seriously, diapers smell, so stop whinning!",[]
"This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.",[]
"I guess if you were leaving it for a week or more, you might have an issue.",[]
"But I think this product works wonderfully, and doesn't smell.",[]
"So many people recommended the Diaper Genie to my husband and me before we had our baby, but I had used it before at other peoples' houses and at church and just wasn't that impressed.",[]
"It was difficult to use, and the bags sometimes broke in the twisting process.",[]
"So, despite advice to the contrary, we registered for the Diaper Champ.The risk was WELL worth it!",[]
"It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.",[]
"Speaking of bags, the biggest draw of this diaper disposal is that you can use your own...whatever kind of garbage bags you have lying around (translated: ""cheap""...much cheaper than special refills).Yes, it does stick, but that's usually when I've been too lazy to change the bag after filling it to the very brim and then some.And we haven't noticed any smell at all (although she IS still breastfeeding).",[]
We're so glad we went with this disposal!,[]
"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift before I had my second son in May, 2002.",[]
"We had our baby girl in December, 2003, so two babies were then using that pail.",[]
"It truly seals in odors, all with a regular garbage bag.",[]
"(No pricy ""special"" bags to buy!)",[]
"For two years, the room remained odor-free.",[]
"Over recent months, we've started noticing an odor, but the pail has been doing twice the work for a year now!",[]
"We used a different pail with our first son, and were not pleased with it.",[]
I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.,[]
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.,[]
I love the Diaper Champ!!!,[]
"It's great that you don't have to fuss with expensive bag refills, you just use regular bags.",[]
There has been no smell at all...if you remember to chane it once it fills up... and the size is great.,[]
It's so easy to use even for my kids.,[]
The best thing is that my 5 year old and 2 year old boys LOVE to throw their little sister's diapers away.,[]
"I think the price is great, considering you won't have to spend allot on refill bags.",[]
I looked at a lot of online reviews of diaper pails before I registered for the Diaper Champ.,[]
I'm glad I did because hands down this is the best thing I received at my shower.,[]
My baby is now two months old and we stuff this thing full of dirty diapers.,[]
You can't smell a thing until you open it up to take the bag out to the trash.,[]
When you put the dirty diapers in you just drop it into the chute and flip the diaper over into the garbage bag.,[]
"You never even open it up, so CLEVER!",[]
My sister used the Diaper Genie and she had to keep it in the other room because it smelled so bad.,[]
"The Diaper Champ also uses regular garbage bags, which is much more cost effective.",[]
I love this pail-I couldn't live without it!You can buy regular garbage bags (I suggest the pink scented kind) and don't have to worry about refills.,[]
Plus this pail holds  a LOT of diapers...and doesn't smell up the room.The flipping mechanism is easy and smart.,[]
"When you open the lid to change the bag...it is a little hard to open, just put the pail between your knees to hold it down the then pull open the top.",[]
I can do it with no problem and I'm a weakling!,[]
Good luck!,[]
Assembly was really easy-I'm not even close to handy and I was able to get it together in about 5 minutes.Changing the bags is easy-I don't have a problem getting the diaper champ open-and since it uses regular trash bags there's no need to buy the expensive liners.We've been using this for 14 months and have never had a problem with odor and trust me it's not because my daughters diapers smell like daisies!,"[('easy-i', 0.1054948095756506)]"
"After reading multiple reviews, we decided to buy the Diaper Champ right before the adoption of our two babies became final.",[]
"That was over a year ago, and the Diaper Champ would still be my product of choice.",[]
"It's expensive enough to BUY diapers never mind having to buy those ""special"" (and expensive) diaper bags used in other products.",[]
The maintenance price is ridiculous!,[]
"We don't put poopy diapers in the Diaper Champ, change it regularly and spray it with Lysol.",[]
My house NEVER smells like dirty diapers.,[]
It's totally unrealistic to expect anything more from a container that contains human waste!,[]
!,[]
I love this product.,[]
You can use any regular trash bag.,[]
So far we have noticed NO odors.,[]
It is easy to use.,[]
"It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ.",[]
The price is very affordable as well.,[]
We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.,[]
We hated that thing!,[]
"The ""new"" design still needs lots of improvement!",[]
The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.,[]
And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.,[]
We decided we had to have something so we started researching.,[]
The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!,[]
We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.,[]
There is also no trick to it.,[]
No spinning it or anyhting!,[]
Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!,[]
We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!,[]
It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!,[]
I received the Diaper Champ at my baby shower and have been using it since day one.,[]
"I loved it when I got it and now that I have used it for 1 1/2 years, I still love it!",[]
"(First of all, if you have a poop smearing issue in your Diaper Champ, it's because you don't know how to roll a diaper closed and seal it with the tabs.",[]
"That's just gross, sorry I had to go there.)",[]
"Now that I have made my previous comment, even after the weight of the plunger pushed the diaper down, I have never had the issue of a ""dirty"" plunger.",[]
The only cleaning I do to mine is wipe it down with a Clorox wipe once a week and spray it out with Lysol disinfectant spray everytime I change the bag.,[]
"I also use Glad Odor Shield kitchen bags in mine and I have never had an odor problem.My Diaper Champ is still in great condition, never had a broken part and never had a reason to need to take it a part.I would HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone who needs a WONDERFUL diaper pail.",[]
This is one of the best things that we got as a shower present.,[]
"It requires no additional expense, other than regular trash bags (unlike the diaper genie) and it really works!",[]
"I was skeptical that it blocked odors as claimed, but I am convinced: I forgot to change a full bag of dirty diapers before we left for a week of vacation (we have no a/c and it was really hot that week) ...We came home a week later and our daughter's room didn't smell bad at all.I do use Glad trash bags with the odor guard, wipe it out occasionally with Clorox wipes and I do keep a drier sheet in the bottom of the diaper champ just to ensure that it remains ""nice"" ... but that's more about keeping it clean than anything else.Bottom line, the diaper champ is something that we absolutely couldn't and still can't live without!",[]
"I just bought the ""new & improved"" Diaper Champ & it is great!",[]
it is a little bit shorter than the orig.,[]
"one but it holds up more diapers, no foul odor & it has a wider opening.",[]
it's sooo easy to assemble plus you just need regular trash bags.,[]
The model # is 4100 by Baby Trend.,[]
what a champ!!,[]
!,[]
I have 1 year old twins and a 2 year old.,[]
"So yes, I have 3 babies in diapers.",[]
I have never smelled any odor coming from the diaper champ.,[]
(Except when you open it to take the bag out of course!),[]
We stuff it full of poopy diapers all day long and we have no odor whatsoever.,[]
To the girl who said it was stinky: I just don't believe it.,[]
I have reccomended this to plenty of friends and they all love it as much as I do.My mother-in-law runs a day care from her house and she has 6 babies in diapers.,[]
She loves the diaper champ.,[]
Need I say more?,[]
I've tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.,[]
"It is easy to change the bag, uses any trash bag, and does a decent job of containing odor.",[]
I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.,[]
I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.,[]
"Let's face it....no diaper pail is perfect, but this one is the best that I've used.",[]
"I bought this for my third baby since we had moved into a two story, I felt that I had to have a diaper pail in the baby's room.",[]
"I had the genie with my second, but hated buying the refils, so I had gotten rid of that long before..I used it some in the first months, but his diapers really weren't that stinky ( breastfed)so odor wasn't really a factor.",[]
Then as he got older we were always changing him down on the main floor then walking out the garage and putting it in the garbage if stinky..Buying the champ was pretty much a wast of money for me.,[]
"I took it to OUAC today and they had never seen it before and seemed impressed with it, only to give me [a few dollars] for it!!!!!",[]
"!Other than that, if you really need  to keep a diaper pail in the baby's room, then it does seem to keep the smell in pretty good.",[]
I bought this item because my first diaper pail broke.,[]
I'm glad to say that I'm very happy with my purchase!,[]
It does very well at keeping the smell away.,[]
"When baby starts solids, their diapers stink!",[]
"With this pail, I don't smell anything.",[]
I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.,[]
I use a regular small kitchen bag and it takes a good 3-4 days before it needs changing.,[]
The Diaper Champ is a winner in my book!,[]
"Forget the diaper genie, too many twists and turns, not to mention the cost of bag refills.",[]
The diaper champ is simple to use and no smells.,[]
Look no further.,[]
"I absolutely loved the older version, it did a great job of containing odors for about 15 months.",[]
It started to smell and cleaning didn't fix the problem so we replaced it with the new version of the diaper champ.,[]
I'm so disappointed.,[]
"When you put a diaper in and flip it, all the stinky air comes flying out and it's horrible.",[]
The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.,[]
I'd keep looking for a better diaper pail rather than buy the new diaper champ.,[]
"Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that's why I gave it 1 star.",[]
However...the thing REALLY stinks!!,[]
Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it.,[]
"However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago.",[]
"I thought...""Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners""...Well that was a HUGE mistake!!",[]
I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!!,[]
"My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor!",[]
"After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop!",[]
I couldn't stand it!,[]
"In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times.",[]
Is that really saving money??,[]
I don't think so!,[]
Plus her room really smelled bad.,[]
I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again!,[]
"The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!",[]
We opted to register for this diaper pail because it didn't require costly refills.,[]
"It seemed to work well at first, although the changing of bags was a bit of a pain.",[]
"By the time my son was 8 months old, the pail began to stink a lot.",[]
We always wiped it down and sprayed it with Lysol.,[]
"Eventually, a piece of foam from inside (I'm guessing this helped to keep the smells inside) came loose.",[]
We finally had to throw it out when my son was 9 1/2 months old.,[]
My neighber who had a baby at the same time also owned the Champ and had to toss her's out when her daughter was 5 months old.,[]
The same thing happened to her.We are now expecting our second child and are in the process of buying a new pail - probably the Neat System.,[]
This is great!,[]
It's simple to use- which new moms anad dads especially love!,[]
And like another stated- you use REGULAR garbage bags- way more cost effective!,[]
You can get good bags in  bulk and still pay way less than the diaper genie refills.,[]
I haven't had an odor problem and I agree all pails will lessen in effectiveness as their diets change- your poop doesn't smell like roses either!,[]
"HAHHA My husband told the husband of my friend that purchased this for us- (they didn't have kids at the time) ""I know you don't know what it is- but it's GREAT thank you!""",[]
Now if it gets the men talking- it's a product worth checking into.oh and when the piston seems to stick change the bag or start wrapping the diapers with it's tabs so they don't stick to the side and cause problems.,[]
I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!,[]
I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.,[]
It was such a pain to use.,[]
We all hated it.,[]
The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.,[]
And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.,[]
It takes regular trash bags.,[]
"I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.",[]
"And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!",[]
"If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!",[]
"Well this was a great diaper pail in the beginning, but once god put smell into those little angels poops the diaper lost it's place in the house.",[]
Now we keep the pail out on the porch.,[]
"Its still a good product in the sense that we dont have to buy those expensive refills and it will hold a good 4-5 days of diapers , but it would be nice to keep it inside next to the changing table where it belongs.",[]
All in all someone needs to come out with somthing better.,[]
I bought this because after using a diaper genie for a year because I realized it would pay for itself after a month and a half of not having to buy diaper genie refills!,[]
It works as well as the diaper genie.,[]
The key is to empty it as soon as it is full.,[]
I also sprinkle Arm & Hammer trash odor neutralizer (scented baking powder) in after especially stinky diapers.,[]
"It is way easier to empty and refill with a normal trash bag than the diaper genie, which I used to dread having to replace the liner in!",[]
I got the diaper champ at my baby shower and used it from the begining.,[]
"It was wonderful, it didn't smell and it held LOTS of diapers.",[]
I was glad I got it after finding out from my sister that she had to replace her bag from her diaper genie every other day in the begining and then a least 2 times a week when my neice was older.,[]
At $6 a bag I saved a ton of money with this product.,[]
However now that my daughter is a year and on all regular adult foods the diaper champ isn't holding in the smell very well at all.,[]
I've been replacing the bag every day to prevent the smell from getting too bad but it's a pain to do so I'm thinking about getting a different diaper disposal system for now.,[]
we have had multiple problems with this pail giving off too much odor.,[]
"we have tried to wash it out multiple times, use lysol, baking soda, and even put the diapers in a powder scented bag prior putting them in the pail.",[]
when calling the manufacturer they said it was probably a bad seal.,[]
they then sent us 2 brand new seals for free-which was wonderful.,[]
my husband replaced the seal which didn't solve the problem...so we placed two seals all together and it still continued to smell.,[]
we have since then moved it outside which is not very convenient and now the pail doesn't get used very often.,[]
This is such an easy and clean way to dispose of dirty diapers!,[]
"Quick, one hand operation & NO odor problems!!",[]
!,[]
It seems as if everyone having a problem with this hasnt figured out how to properly fold up a dirty diaper with wipes inside!,[]
It won't jam or smear with poop if you put the dirty wipes inside the dirty diaper and wrap the whole thing up like a diaper burrito.,[]
Use the diapers own tapes to create a capsule shaped package.,[]
"Of course loose wipes will get smeary in the chute, come on!!",[]
!,[]
We bought a Diaper Champ before our first baby was born.,[]
We loved it.,[]
It held up fine the entire time our daughter was in diapers (2 years).,[]
"We did empty it every 1-2 days (and wiped out with bleach or antiseptic wipes) once she started eating solids, even if it wasn't full.",[]
"I did find that if I left the diapers sitting in there too long, it made changing the garbage bag a very smelly chore (although I didn't find that the smell escaped the diaper pail itself).",[]
"Overall, we loved this diaper pail the first time around and are buying another one for our second child (plus another Diaper Champ for the grandparents' house!",[]
).,[]
This model is great!,[]
"You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.",[]
I do recommend that you buy an air freshner because the Diaper Champ doesn't completely hide the smell.,[]
This is a great diaper pail.,[]
There is no odor and it is very easy to use.,[]
(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.),[]
"Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).",[]
And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.,[]
"As new parents, we have found it truly amazing how much money goes for all the little extras--batteries, film, pacifiers, wet wipes, etc.",[]
"This is one reason I passed up the diaper genie, which although is a great product from what I've heard, requires the frequent purchase of refills which can be complicated to install.",[]
"So we decided to go for the Diaper Champ, which just requires normal trash bags which you're going to buy any way.",[]
"On the whole, it's worked well.",[]
"To diminish the likelihood of bad odors in the nursery, one should change the bag frequently, before it gets full.",[]
"The one problem is the mechanism it uses to &quot;roll&quot; the diaper into the chamber often gets stuck if you use diapers with sticky tabs--velcro diaper tabs, no problem.",[]
Overall I like this product and I like not having yet one more expense like refills.,[]
"The Champ is a great diaper disposal system, but smells do leak out.",[]
"As soon as you open the system to take the bag out, all of those diapers do smell up the place!",[]
"I can not say that I am 100% satisfied with this type of disposal system, I just wish there was a better way of taking out the bag without smelling up the entire room!",[]
This is a great pail except for the heavy lid.,[]
Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand.,[]
"The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor.",[]
"This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.",[]
I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!,[]
!,[]
At first me and my husband didnt know if we really wanted to get diaper pails for our twins.,[]
We thought since the babies were going to be at his parents house while we were at work.,[]
A garbage can would do just as well.,[]
We did reg for the diaper champ to keep at the grandparents house.,[]
We ended up getting 1 for their home and 2 for our home.,[]
We are SO HAPPY we did.,[]
They are so easy to use.,[]
You dont have to push the dirty diaper down with your hand you just lay it in the champ and turn the handle over.,[]
At 6 months old yes the diapers are starting to get bigger but you just fold them with the velco of the diapers and its so easy.,[]
Ive had no problems of getting them stuck.,[]
With the diaper champ you can use any kind of bags which is great!!!,[]
There really is no oder with the diaper champ.,[]
"We take the dirty diaper out every 4-5 days depends on how many we go through in a weeks time :), but even when their is a ""dirty"" diaper there is no smell in the room.",[]
"Sometimes if we have a very ""messy diaper"" we just take it directly to the garage.",[]
All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama.,[]
We wash it out once a month or sooner with bleach and water just help get rid of some germs.,[]
We also spray it with cleaner weekly to help with those nasty germs!,[]
All around its a great product.,[]
"It really is hands free, which means less mess, and their is no costly replacement bags that you have to mess around with!",[]
"As a first-time mommy, I have been pleasantly surprised by the Diaper Champ!",[]
It was incredibly easy to assemble and even easier to use on a day-to-day basis.,[]
"When the bag is almost full, there may be a slight ""puff"" of odor as the plunger drops, but that just lets me know that it is time to change the bag (which, by the way, is a regular tall trash bag and not those expensive liners that other diaper pails use!!).","[('bag', 0.13793445559289536)]"
"I spray it with Lysol with each bag change (every 5 days or so), and that's it!",[]
"Low maintenance, High satisfaction!!",[]
"My daughter is now 8 months old, and I have only one complaint: it IS a little difficult to open without almost breaking a nail!",[]
"However, all in all, it is a must-have.",[]
Great diaper pail.,[]
It is very simple.,[]
Uses any bag.,[]
I haven't had any problems at all with it and it holds odor extremely well (until you open it!),[]
But all in all a great diaper pail....definitely recommend!,[]
!,[]
This is by far the best diaper pail I have used yet!,[]
"I have four children and as you can imagine, I have changed, and discarded my share of diapers over the years.",[]
"We had, with our first child, an ordinary old diaper pail that used a trash bag.",[]
It was stinky and gross and needed to be emptied atleast once daily.,[]
"Then, with our second child, we got a diaper genie which worked pretty well compared to the old diaper pail.",[]
"It was a little stinky, but compared to what we were used to, it really wasn't that bad.",[]
"Then, by our third child, the diaper genie fell apart and really began to stink, not to mention that the liners were really adding up in price.",[]
We finally tossed the diaper genie in the trash and began looking for a better pail.,[]
We saw the diaper champ at babies r us and thought it was a great idea since it used regular trash bags and was still supposed to reduce the stink of the diapers.,[]
"So far, it is AWESOME!!",[]
We use the glad trash bags with the odor reducing patch on them.,[]
"The diaper champ does a great job, is VERY simple to use, and we can go about 5 days without having to empty it.",[]
I am very pleased with the diaper champ and my only regret is that we didn't buy one sooner.,[]
"I have been a Diaper Genie user for four years, but when my second daughter's diapers became more and more smelly, I decided to try a newer diaper disposal method.",[]
"I checked out the reviews, asked around, and decided to buy the Diaper Champ, or Chump as I now call it.",[]
"I will say that the disposal mechanism is great--just drop in the diapers, flip the handle, and voila--it's disposed.",[]
"I also was sold on the idea of not having to have special refills for the Chump, being able to use any old trash or plastic shopping bag.",[]
"I tried a regular shopping bag at first, and after one day of wet and dirty diapers, I had major odor issues.",[]
"I tried a special ""odor shield"" trash bag next, with no improvement.",[]
I tried spraying in additional odor neutralizers.,[]
Nope.,[]
The Chump still made my poor baby's room stink like nobody's business.,[]
"I'm back to happily using my old Genie, even if it's harder to use/empty/refill than the Chump.",[]
At least it keeps the odors away until I'm ready to empty it.,[]
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.,[]
Mine was returned and the money used for Genie refills!!!,[]
!,[]
We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite.,[]
"I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion.",[]
I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor.,[]
"When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.",[]
"I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!",[]
I did love this product for the first year.,[]
but my oldest is 3years old and we've been through two of these and now off to buy something else for my 15 month old.,[]
The seal on the cover doesn't last long which is why it smells.,[]
When we first get the new one it works great for a few months and then it starts smelling.,[]
We change it every other day and my 3 year old is potty trained so I'm only using it with one toddler.,[]
The fact that you don't need to buy special bags is great but I wish they would figure out a better way to contain the smells.,[]
We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!,[]
"Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.",[]
Only problem...it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.,[]
The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.,[]
We bought this one because it can be used with cloth or disposable diapers and uses regular (ie.,[]
cheap) garbage bags.,[]
"For cloth diapers, you can even use a laundry bag.",[]
"Since we are using both cloth and disposables, we have two!",[]
"The system works great and there is no noticeable smell (although our son is a breastfed baby, so smell is at a minimum anyway).",[]
"We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.",[]
Make sure the velcro is fastened before turning the handle to dispose of the diaper (and make sure your husband does this as well!).,[]
I have heard that you shouldn't dispose of loose wipes without putting them in the diaper first.,[]
"Since we are using cloth diapers, we often throw the disposable wipes in the disposable pail loose without a diaper and have had no problems so far!",[]
Wow this thing is great!,[]
It uses any cheap trash bag and we have detected absolutely no odor coming from it!!,[]
My son loves to throw away the diapers for me because it is so easy to use!!,[]
This thing is awesome!,[]
I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.,[]
Would highly recommend to everyone!,[]
"i don't know what size bags ""new mom"" is using but this diaper pail definitely fits more than 10 newborn diapers!",[]
I can fit about 20 size 3 diapers before it needs to be changed.,[]
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SYSTEM- WAY BETTER THAN THE DIAPER GENIE.,[]
HANDS DOWN!,[]
The Champ is a champ we say.,[]
"It is great and you don't have to buy special bags, as with the Genie.",[]
It is so simple to use - fantastic product.,[]
We have 3 kids under 3 and we love it!,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
"I just had my third baby and with my first 2 I used the Diaper Genie, aka Diaper Pain.",[]
I love the ease of use of this item.,[]
"It couldn't be faster or easier to use, one flip of the hand...truely one handed.",[]
"Also, it's a little taller than the Genie, so you don't have to bend over to use it.",[]
"This may not seem that important, but when you are changing diapers every couple of hours, it makes a big difference.",[]
I rated it a 4 and not a 5 because my baby is not on solids yet.,[]
There has been NO smell at all but I can't attest to what happens when the stinky ones come along.,[]
I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.,[]
When you open the pail to empty it's easy to cinch the bag quickly at the opening...perhaps that will help as well.,[]
"The best part, no expensive refills and it's so easy, even my little kids can dispose of the diaper.",[]
(noone other than me could ever figure out how to use the Genie...they'd just leave the diaper balanced on top).,[]
"Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.",[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
"While the diaper champ is not perfect, it is really good!",[]
No special bags to buy!,[]
One hand diaper disposal and very easy to clean!,[]
I change the bag 2-3 times a week and before I put a new bag back in I use mr.clean and clean it up real good.,[]
No odors and really easy!,[]
"We received this diaper pail as a shower present 7 months ago and we love it, especially since baby started solids.",[]
":) We have had no problems with odors and love the fact that we can use regular trash bags in it (not buying bags & refills saves so much money, considering how long the baby is in diapers).",[]
"We are using scented trash bags as double protection, which also helps to keep the room smelling fresh.",[]
"I feel the size of it is just right, making me dispose of the diapers every 5-7 days.",[]
"Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.",[]
":) And since the design of the diaper pail makes it so easy to use (just a simple flip - no twisting involved), I had to give it 5 stars.",[]
I've worked with kids more than half my life.,[]
First as a babysitter /nanny and now as a mother.,[]
I've used diaper genies and they've all been really smelly.,[]
I never had to deal with changing cartridges but I can imagine how annoying it could be to open that stench-filled object and take out the poop sausage.,[]
I love my diaper champ.,[]
It's so easy to use.,[]
I never had a problem with it squishing my finger because I always remember that the lid is heavy.,[]
No smell escapes from it and I keep it in my bathroom.,[]
We'll see if I still love it once my DD's soiled diapers become stinky.,[]
I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ.,[]
I prefer the Diaper Champ because it does not utilize expensive refills and it keeps the odor in better than the Diaper Dekor.,[]
"The Diaper Dekor broke, the arm that lifts the lid up broke off.",[]
So I had to go searching for a new product again since they discontinued the model that I was using.,[]
"I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.",[]
"Let's face it, even the best can't keep in that smell, especially as your child gets older.",[]
"I have two children now, so the Diaper Champ is getting utilized quite a bit and it beats the competition hands down.",[]
"After researching about all of the diaper pails out there, my husband and I decided the Diaper Champ sounded the easiest and most economical.",[]
"I have to say, I am so glad we did!!",[]
This diaper pail is the best-I have a friend who put the Diaper Genie on her registry and she hates it.,[]
"She barely uses it because she runs out of the bags...but with the Champ, you can use any trash bag.",[]
I heard some people complain about it smelling but I haven't had any problems what-so-ever.,[]
"I do clean it about once a month, just like I do with my regular trash can in the kitchen, but it takes 5 minutes TOPS to clean it!",[]
"All in all, this is a great registry item.",[]
"Also, my daughter now waves ""bye, bye"" to her dirty diaper when I turn the handle.",[]
The Champ is the dirty diaper champ!!,[]
!,[]
With our first two children we used the diaper genie.,[]
"I was tired of buying the extra inserts, so I decided to try the diaper champ with our third.",[]
The concept is great.,[]
I loved the idea of using our own garbage bags and flipping the diapers into the pail seemed so easy.,[]
What a disapointment!,[]
Within a few days we found major flaws with the system.,[]
The pail didn't seem to hold many diapers.,[]
"They stacked up on top of eachother and began to clog the chute the diapers ""flipped"" in.",[]
"Even though there was plenty of room in the pail (it would only be half full), the plunger would stick and we would have to push down on it to get the diaper through the small hole inside the pail.",[]
"The bottom of the plunger would then touch the dirty diapers below it so that the next time you had to push it down, your hand would be wet from the previous diaper.",[]
It was pretty gross.,[]
"We did what the manufacturer recommended and bundled the diaper before disposal, but this didn't help.",[]
It seemed to make the back-ups worse.,[]
The champ was also difficult to open.,[]
I chipped my fingernails everytime we emptied it.,[]
"Finally, it is a lot bulkier than the genie and took up more space in our already small nursery.",[]
"Needless to say, three weeks into #3, we ditched the champ and bought a new genie which we absolutely love.",[]
I have owned both the diaper genie and champ.,[]
"After about 6 months of use, both began to smell some.",[]
Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.,[]
"The diaper champ is much eaiser to use, bigger, and smells less.",[]
And it's a bonus to use regular trash bags.,[]
I would recomend the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie.,[]
"This is much better than the Genie, it doesn't smell as bad if you take your trash out on a regular basis.",[]
The only way I can keep it from smelling is to put a cloth wet with pine-sol in the bottom.,[]
This generally works for 3 or 4 days.,[]
"However, the capacity is not that great especially if you have twins!",[]
(But what is except for a 33 gallon trash can with a hole in the top!),[]
"The capacity is really the only thing I can complain about, even with one baby it seemed to fill up pretty fast.",[]
"It is convient, no twisting, turning, or shoving the diapers like you have to with the Genie.",[]
"And the use of any bag is great, too!",[]
"Although, it seems to tear everytime I change it.",[]
"Overall, for the price and for one baby, it's not too bad.",[]
My husband picked out this diaper pail because it uses regular garbage bags instead of pricey refills.,[]
I have to say that we absolutely love it!,[]
"It is very easy to use, just put the diaper in the top and flip the handle.",[]
"No smashing or twisting, which my husband really likes!",[]
We've been using it for two weeks now and haven't noticed any smells getting through.,[]
I am the mother of a toddler and pregnant with my second and needed to buy a new diaper pail system.,[]
I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.,[]
"I love the Diaper Champ, it holds more diapers, is easy to use and doesn't require special liners.",[]
The only downfall is that when you put toddler diapers in this pail it does smell.,[]
I just keep Lysol close by and use scented garbage bags.,[]
Luckily the toddler is almost trained and infant diapers don't smell.,[]
This system is much better than the diaper genie.,[]
My husband and I debated between the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ.,[]
Several friends recommended the Diaper Champ because it used ordinary kitchen bags rather than specialized bags like the Diaper Genie requires.,[]
So - we went with the Diaper Champ.,[]
"Through time, like all other diaper pails, odor will permeate into the plastic container.",[]
My daughter is now two and I'm expecting #2 in October.,[]
I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.,[]
"I highly recommend this product especially for the ease of use, cost efficient bagging system and odor eliminating feature.",[]
When we went shopping for baby i knew one thing--that I didn't want a diaper genie!,[]
After years of being a nanny I knew that they are complicated to use and the refill bags get expensive.,[]
Who wants to buy more than one type of garbage bag?,[]
"When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.",[]
"Anyone who can lift a handle can work this product, and anyone can change the bag.",[]
I put it together when I was on bedrest!,[]
I recommend it to everyone.,[]
We bought this b/c a cousin recommended it to us.,[]
It worked okay for a few months but then it began to smell from dirty diapers.,[]
I think the seal wears out after awhile but I've never seen replacements for it.,[]
I'm having my second baby now and don't plan on getting it back out for this one b/c it was a rip off.,[]
We just keep a regular waste basket in the room for wet diapers and then another waste basket with a lid outside for dirty diapers.,[]
I researched all the available options and decided to try the Diaper Champ instad of diaper genie.,[]
It made diaper disposal a snap!!,[]
The one handed disposal was soo convenient when i was holding a squirmy baby with one arm.,[]
It is smell free if you empty frequently and almost so if you don't.,[]
This thing lived next to my sidetable for the first few months and often it was only emptied when it was full (its pretty large).,[]
I used some simple tricks to prevent smell leakage:-Rolled and taped up the diapers securely before disposing-Always returned the handle to original position so that only one side of the opening stayed in contact with smelly diapers (you'll know what i mean when you use it)-Used scented odor lock GLAD bags and aired out the champ between bag changesThe only cons I found were that opening it is a bit tough ( you get more adept at it though and its safer) and there is a small opening below the handle which is where the odor tends to escape when it does.The cons are pretty minor given how well this thing works AND it is cost effective...i hate the idea of being forced to buy brand specific refills.,"[('diapers', 0.09586089748917827)]"
It may seem bulky and not great to look at but I have to admit i have at times emptied the champ only when it could not take a single more diaper.,[]
I almost returned this when i opened it and saw how large it was but i am so glad i kept it!,[]
!,[]
"I had a Diaper Genie with my other children, and hated it.",[]
With our newest we bought the Diaper Champ and I'm SOOO glad we did!!,[]
We don't have a problem with the nursery smelling at all!!,[]
"It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!",[]
We also love how slim it is...fits into a corner nicely!,[]
!,[]
"This pail is so easy to use and economical, I can not say enough good things about it.",[]
I just started using it 4 days ago with my newborn's diapers and it holds alot.,[]
The best thing is that it allows my 3 year old daughter to help out.,[]
I put the diaper in and she can &quot;flip&quot; the lid to make the diaper disappear.,[]
"With my firstborn, we used the diaper genie, but the refills were expensive and it was hard to use, even though it kept the smell out.",[]
This pail does not smell and it's so easy to use.,[]
I highly recommend it!,[]
My husband and I love the Diaper Champ - it makes diaper changes quick and easy.,[]
"We make sure to wrap up all the dirty wipes in the dirty diaper before depositing it, so it doesn't get stuck in the shoot.",[]
"Each time the bag is full, we empty the pail, spray Lysol inside and out, and replace the bag.",[]
"We've had it for almost 3 months now, and can't complain.",[]
We were really happy to purchase the diaper champ mainly because it used regular garbage bags unlike many of the competing diaper pails.,[]
The champ was great until our baby started solid foods.,[]
"The champ begins to smell after only 1 poopy diaper and despite cleaning it and lysoling it, the smell still lingers and I need to throw it out and buy a new one.",[]
"From what I have heard from most people is that no matter what product you use, smell is always going to be a factor.",[]
This product is simple and easy to setup and use.,[]
No special bags to purchase.,[]
"To store diaper, you just slip the diaper in and flip the handle.",[]
"No smell from within is possible.The only downside is when you pull the bag out, you have to tie it shut and can get a wiff.",[]
We change our bags twice a week (trash days).,[]
"The smell is not that bad and our bags have a lovely baby powder scent so it compensates.At least we don't have to deal with diaper ""links"" or the possibility of the links unravelling.",[]
All we do is tie the bag at the top and put in a new bag.,[]
We recieved the Diaper Champ as a gift from a friend and truly love it.,[]
It is so easy to use and we have not experienced any smells.,[]
We change the bag quite frequently because it is after all a diaper pail.,[]
Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.,[]
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!,[]
I strongly recommend it.,[]
"I registered for this item because I heard good things, well it is good UNTIL your baby starts eating baby food and has more bowel movements.",[]
"This pail lasted me until my baby was 5 months old, then the pail does not hold in odor.",[]
I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.,[]
So use your judgement but be prepared to have odors once the baby starts eating baby food.,[]
"We purchased this diaper disposal system after looking at all the others, comparing features and prices.",[]
"We decided to go with this one, based on it's larger than most size and from the positive reviews it got.",[]
WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,[]
I T  S T I N K S - L I T E R A L L Y!!!!!,[]
"The first couple of days, it was fine.",[]
Then we started noticing the odor and it just got worse the longer we used it.,[]
"Whether there's one diaper or ten, it stinks the same.",[]
It performs the same as the cheap $2.00 plastic garbage can with lid that I originally used in the beginning (I should've just kept that one and saved my money).,[]
You can literally smell the awful odor permeating through the plastic.,[]
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!,[]
YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!,[]
!,[]
I have tried numerous diaper pails and this was the last one I had to buy.,[]
I first got the Diaper Genie.,[]
"That was a pain with the special refills and it was a hassle to have to turn the ""lever"" to drop the diaper in and seal it.",[]
I also had a Fisher Price pail that wasn't very good either.,[]
"Same kind of concept where you had to turn a ""lever"".",[]
"Then, I came across the Diaper Champ.",[]
I love it!!!,[]
You can use any regular trash bag so there are no special bags to buy.,[]
It is very easy to drop the diaper in.,[]
Just put it in the hole on top and move the handle from back to front or front to back.,[]
It is so easy that my 3 year old can do it.,[]
Very hassle free and it keeps odors contained pretty well as compared with others that I have had.,[]
Don't waste time on others when you can get it right the first time.,[]
"I got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift and was disappointed, because of some bad reviews I did not think it would work.",[]
"I took the Diaper Genie to my Mom's house, since she babysits during the day, and I purchased the Diaper Champ for my house.",[]
The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.,[]
I have purchased a Diper Genie for my house and it is working wonderfully all you have to do is follow the directions.,[]
"I did all the research and asked all my friends w/kids about their diaper disposal systems - and this one, for the money and ability to use your own bags, seemed like the best choice.Basically, in a nutshell, it's fine until the more &quot;fragrant&quot; diapers arrive (you all know what I mean) and by then, it's best to take out the trash bag every other day, unless you have no sense of smell and/or don't mind the lingering &quot;what's that smell?&quot; smell that's slowing filling up the babies room...","[('quot', 0.12010300069662293)]"
"Hence, it's &quot;large capacity&quot; isn't really a benefit anymore, because you're taking out a trash bag that's 1/3 full (and 100% smelly) at best.The small circular &quot;chute&quot; that you put the diaper in is a little small too - I can't imagine this working too well once my kid is about 9-12 months old and really giving us some whoppers to dispose of.","[('quot', 0.1863917642441656)]"
"I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.","[('quot', 0.2138781132003445)]"
"I'm sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense here, I suggest you go visit the store and take it out of the box to see it to get a better understanding of what it does and how it's supposed to work.However, with all that said - I still think, for $30, it's manageable - I don't have a problem taking out the bag every other day, as I'd much rather use my own trash bags than spend more money on separate &quot;special&quot; bags that have to be used for a different kind of system, which can cost a lot more.If I had to grade this item - I'd give it a solid &quot;B-&quot;, it's just a hair above average, it does the job, but it's not all it says it is.","[('quot', 0.12102393695667057)]"
"But as with anything, what really is 100% perfect (besides our children, of course) and we are just talking about disposing diapers...",[]
Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.,[]
Got the Diaper Champ from day one and would highly recommend!,[]
I use regular 13 gallon kitchen garbage bags that I guy from [a local store].,[]
Far cheaper than the refills for the Genie and you get tons more!,[]
Contains the odor of poopy diapers very well.,[]
Nursery never smells!,[]
Holds lots of diapers too!,[]
"Garbage pick up is twice a week, and those are the two days I change the bag... And we all know how often babies dirty their diapers!",[]
Fantastic capacity!,[]
Highly recommend!,[]
I really like the Diaper Champ.,[]
You can use any type of bag (I buy scented bags from the dollar store.),[]
I empty the pail about every four days and my baby's room does not smell.,[]
"My only problem with the product, I can't seem to open the lid without drawing blood!",[]
The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.,[]
"Other than that, I recommend this product.",[]
I registered for this diaper pal because I did not want to have to buy refills.,[]
I use regular kitchen garbage bags in the Diaper Champ which are much more affordable.,[]
It is easy to use and I have not smelled any odors.,[]
"Works great, easy to use, no odor (if used properly).",[]
"Using plastic kitchen bags with draw strings, solves many possible problems",[]
I have two children and with my first used a Diaper Genie.,[]
"While I liked the Genie, it was cumbersome to use and the refills were expensive and inconvenient.",[]
So this time around we registered for and received the Diaper Champ.We are loving it!,[]
"It is so easy to use, uses regular trash bags or plastic grocery bags, and does a good job of containing the smell.",[]
"To be fair, the thing holds DIRTY DIAPERS so when we open it to change bags, it doesn't smell like potpourri.",[]
Nor do I expect it to.,[]
":)  But while it is closed, the odors are contained.",[]
The openings to put diapers in are much bigger than the opening on the diaper genie and you just pull a handle to dispose of the diaper (as opposed to squishing the diaper in and twisting with the diaper genie).I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.,[]
It is worth the money.,[]
Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.,[]
This one is really great.,[]
I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.,[]
"I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.",[]
Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!,[]
We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.,[]
The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!,[]
We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.,[]
We just recently had to buy another roll of bags.,[]
SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!,[]
We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.,[]
Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!,[]
!,[]
We actually went through two of the original Diaper Champs and loved them.,[]
The only problem we had and the reason for going through two of them was the liner gave out after a while (several months).,[]
"However, it was odor free.We then decided to go with the ""new & improved"" Diaper Champ.",[]
BIG MISTAKE.,[]
The New Diaper Champ IS HORRIBLE.,[]
"Contrary to the ads, it does not hold more volume than the original.",[]
It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.,[]
"Stick with the original, which is far superior.",[]
"I originally received a different brand as a gift, but after reading the reviews, I returned it and got the Diaper Champ instead.",[]
"Although it is larger than some of the others, it holds a lot of diapers with NO smell!",[]
I really like the fact that you can use any bag with handles so no more [costly] refills.,[]
But I have noticed that it is not odor free.,[]
You do have to remember to thoroughly clean it every other time you change the bag.,[]
But I have owned a Diaper Genie and I would happily buy another one of these over that because of the money saved on refills.,[]
I have been using the Diaper Champ since my daughter was born in October.,[]
No problems.,[]
I love being able to use my regular trash bags.,[]
There is no odor from it-ever.,[]
When I change the bag I spray a little Febreeze in it and let it sit open to air out for a few minutes.,[]
No problem at all.,[]
This product has been great.,[]
"It's easy to use, holds plenty of dirty diapers, takes any kind of bag (this is important!",[]
"), and does not take up too much space.Once in a while the drum gets stuck, but that's only when the pail is too full.Great product!",[]
I was using a Diaper Genie and it began to take on the odor of the diapers after 7 months so I purchased the Diaper Champ as its replacement.,[]
I give this product 2 stars: 1 for its large size and capacity and 1 for the ability to use standard garbage bags.,[]
Other than that it began to stink worse than the Genie after the second day.,[]
"Due to the fact that the diapers just sit in the bottom of the pail without being sealed off, the pail emits an awful odor.",[]
It was the worst purchase I made.,[]
One step above a regular pail.,[]
Hard to open.Stinky.,[]
Stinky.,[]
I am very anal about stinky smells.,[]
I did not want to smell yucky pooey diapers!,[]
This pail works great.,[]
"It uses regular trash bags, which saves the hassle of needing more baby specific materials.",[]
"We use a clorox disinfectant wet wipe to clean it off each time we change the bag out, about every four days or so, and we have NO stinky smells in our home!",[]
"My daughter is 15 mths old, I have had this product since she was born.",[]
I love the fact you don't have to use bags.,[]
I usually purchase the garbage bags with the odor control in them.,[]
"I would just like to say...I have never had a problem with odor, however, as the baby gets older, you may get a smell....this is my suggestion...when your baby starts pooping and its like adult poop and not baby poop..IT SMELLS!",[]
Try taking the bag out!,[]
It's a pretty easy problem to fix!,[]
I would recommend this product to any new mom.,[]
This is one heck of a product.,[]
"Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.",[]
"One hint though, the diapers don't truly disappear; they just go into &quot;any type garbage bag&quot; that you install in the hidden reservoir.",[]
I found this out when the handle wouldn't flip anymore.,[]
"I was perfectly content dumping diapers and flipping to infinity thinking they simply vanished, but my wife said such is not the case...it actually has to be emptied out every so often.Here's the one beef I have with the magical machine though.",[]
"You see, I'm a performance artist.",[]
"After young Dali was born, I used his deposited diapers in my show and the crowds have never been so regular or more pleased.",[]
I take a ten by ten foot canvas and all of little Dali's creations and fling them against the canvas.,[]
The adhesive and random quality of baby poop is simply mind-boggling and nose-numbingly astounding.,[]
PooPoo at the MoMA drew raves.,[]
Das Poopa Der Dusseldorf elicited screams.,[]
But Pooped Paris Pompidou was my personal fave.,[]
"So along came Diaper Champ in my suddenly successful artistic life, and alas there were no more effervescent pampers to pitch, no fetid huggies to hurl.",[]
"My work dried up, but the diaper champ kept on champing.It may prove a little difficult to open, but that's not such a bad thing when you get a whiff of what the Champ has been keeping from your thankful olfactories.",[]
"Overall, the champ has chutzpah and garners my highest recommendation.",[]
"It certainly changed Dali, Gala's and my life.",[]
I am very happy with this diaper pail.,[]
You don't have to buy separate refills...I use plastic grocery store bags and it works great.,[]
Its easy to use and there is no smell (common sense if you empty it regularly).I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.,[]
We got the diaper champ as a shower gift.,[]
"The one good thing about it is that you can use regular trash bags, so you don't have to buy specialty bags to fill it.",[]
"The bad thing is that if you don't change it every other day, it stinks up the whole house.",[]
"I have to bleach it once a week, not to mention keep a box of baking soda in the bottom to help control the smell.",[]
"My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.",[]
"We are planning on getting rid of the diaper champ, and upgrading to diaper dekor.",[]
we decided to buy this after my wife's extensive review search.,[]
It worked quite well for us.,[]
"diaper could get stuck from time to time, but it is not really a big issue.",[]
It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.,[]
"Do you job, carefully fold the soiled diaper before putting in.",[]
"You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.",[]
"Using kitchen bags is another advantage, you will never run out of bags.I don't recommend keeping any soiled diaper inside baby's room.",[]
"Regardless of how good your system is, it will start smelling after some time and temparature.",[]
We bought this over the Genie because you could use regular kitchen bags and with a greater capacity you wouldn't have to change the bag as often.,[]
I was wrong on the last point.,[]
"Because it doesn't keep odor in as well, you really still need to change the bag often.",[]
"This from a mom with a breastfed baby, and supposedly breastmilk diapers have less odor.",[]
"In addition, it is a little tricky to open and close the bin.",[]
The blue insert that holds the bag in can be difficult to manipulate.,[]
No big deal.,[]
"I am still glad we chose this over the Genie, all things considered.",[]
No one can deny that the Diaper Genie is the best at keeping odor out of the nursery.,[]
Wrapping each diaper induvidually in plastic to contain the smell is a brilliant idea.,[]
The downside is that the refills are costly.,[]
It always just seemed like such a waste of money to me.,[]
"Lets face it, diapers are really, really expensive.",[]
It seems outrageous to have to pay even more to throw them away.I definitely prefer the Diaper Champ.,[]
"For the first few months, I just tossed the dirty diapers in.",[]
"Now that my daughter is on solid foods, it's true that her diapers are stinkier.",[]
"Well, I just keep my leftover grocery bags in the changing table drawer and bag the diapers before tossing them in.",[]
"It's the same concept as the Diaper Genie, only get this, it's FREE.",[]
"And in my experience, it works just as well.It's also easier to empty this way.",[]
I always hated emptying the Genie.,[]
"You have to pull out a mile of dirty diapers, or as I called it ""the poo sausage.""",[]
"With the Champ, you just lift the garbage bag out and take it outside.Don't be a sucker and pay tons of extra money just to throw away your already expensive diapers.",[]
I love my Diaper Champ!,[]
"We got so fed up with the Diaper Genie, we went out & bought the Diaper Champ- it is a million times better!",[]
"It's quicker, less stinky, and even my hubby can figure it out!",[]
Added bonus- no more poo-poo sausage chains in our garbage cans!,[]
Used the Diaper Genie with my first child.,[]
It smelled horribly and my husband found it complicated to change.,[]
So much so that he preferred to use a regular can with a lid and change it everyday!,[]
The Diaper Champ was wonderful.,[]
"Easy to use, even one-handed.",[]
"No special cartridges to buy, it uses regular trash bags.",[]
Amazingly oder free !!!!,[]
Where was the Diaper Champ six years ago!!,[]
!,[]
The diaper champ has worked well for us all 11 months since our son was born.,[]
The one-hand chute mechanism is convenient and it's always worked well for us.,[]
The only problem is when it comes time to change the bags.,[]
I've broken my nail several times on the childproof latch and the odor does escape when the pail is opened.,[]
We have found the tradeoff a good one.,[]
"We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.",[]
I would recommend this pail if you are willing to take your time to open it carefully when it's time to change the bag so you don't break your nail or hurt your hand AND can tolerate the odor for the approximate 2 minutes it will take you to change out the bag.,[]
I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.,[]
I have emailed Baby Trend for a refund so I can go buy something else.,[]
I am even nursing my daughter and the stench from her &quot;odorless&quot; pail is horrific.,[]
I cannot believe they didn't make a space for a deodorizer.,[]
I'm pretty shocked at how bad it is!,[]
We just couldn't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills.,[]
This pail is great.,[]
"I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail, to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom.",[]
"It is not difficult to open, and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things, which will be soon (she's 8 months old).",[]
"We change the bag a couple of times a week, and the nursery smells fine.",[]
"At first I thought the Diaper Champ was great, but then my sons diapers began to stink so bad- we finally put the diaper champ at the curb to go with our recycling.",[]
The Diaper Champ made my sons bathroom stink like a diaper pail- NO THANKS!,[]
We went out and bought the Diaper Genie 2- its the best - no stink what so ever in my sons bathroom.,[]
To me it is no big deal to buy the refills for the Diaper Genie 2 because I CAN'T stand nasty diaper smell.,[]
This is one of the BEST shower gifts my husband and I received.,[]
My sister has the diaper genie and it was so inconvient she finally gave up on it.,[]
It doesn't get any easier then the Diaper Champ!,[]
No expensive refills and with one motion *plop* dirty diaper be gone.,[]
"When I was pregnant with my daughter (who is now 2), I made the mistake of putting a Diaper Genie on my registry .",[]
.,[]
.,[]
.,[]
then I realized how much the replacement bags cost and exchanged the Genie for this Diaper Champ.,[]
It was more reasonably priced and you could use regular tall kitchen garbage bags in it.,[]
"As a new mom, I thought this would be the best thing to get for icky smelly diapers.",[]
"Well, I must admit, I was wrong!Some things to note on this ""Diaper Champ"" .",[]
.,[]
.1.,[]
Plan on replacing the bag at least once every two days whether it's full or not!,[]
Otherwise it starts to smell horribly!2.,[]
"You end up wasting garbage bags because you need to change the bag at least every two days (Major waste ~ if the bag is half full, it's shocking!!",[]
Starting to making the Diaper Genie sound a little more reasonable!).3.,[]
"Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!",[]
"A crib, dresser, changing table, rocker and all the other things you need for your baby take up enough space!4.",[]
Cats love this thing and like to knock it over (I imagine the same with dogs?!)5.,[]
Watch out .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
when your child starts to crawl ~ major concern over it falling on them.,[]
And when they get a little older ~ they want to play with it (too unsanitary for this mom!)6.,[]
You can't take it with you .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
.,[]
dilema ~ what do you do when you're not at home .,[]
.,[]
.,[]
hmmm ~ but what about those wonderful little smelly blue bags??,[]
(Another waste of money as far as I am concerned!)7.,[]
Why would you purposely make more work for yourself?,[]
Now you're taking out an extra bag of garbage every day or two!!,[]
A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).,[]
Not to mention that you have to remove the Champ from your babies room to clean it out each time you remove a bag or the odor will set into the plastic (don't forget that Lysol is toxic to babies ~ so you have to leave the Diaper Champ out of your babies room until it airs out all the way!)8.,"[('babies', 0.2675057398509525)]"
What do you do with it when your child is done with diapers?,[]
(Typically around 2 yrs)  Sell it??,[]
Who would want to buy it??,[]
"Ewwwe!OK, so you're probably wondering what I used if I got sick of wasting tall kitchen bags .",[]
.,[]
.,[]
.SIMPLE SOLUTION:  Go to your local Walmart and pick up their largest box of generic ziplock sandwich bags!,[]
They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.,[]
You can easily take them with you when you go out of the house!,[]
"Plus you don't have some ugly large plastic thing sitting in your baby's room that can fall over and hurt them.The way I see it, is the very little effort it takes to put a diaper in a ziplock and toss it in your garbage, you may as well save your money!!",[]
There are many more useful things that babies need than this!,[]
This is the diaper pail to buy!!,[]
First of all it uses kitchen garbage bags which saves money.,[]
"Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.",[]
"I recommend putting dryer sheets in the bags, one in the beginning and another midway.",[]
I then clean with lysol wipes and spray with lysol and let air out before putting on new bag.,[]
I have had no trouble with odors so far.,[]
I recommend this product to anyone.,[]
"I don't think this pail really did everything I was expecting, which was based on the content they provided on their site.",[]
"I had a hard time opening and closing it, and honestly the smells containment was not any greater than a normal trash bin.",[]
"Cute design, but not worthy of higher expectations.",[]
Our daycare provider has the Diaper Genie.,[]
I think that the Champ is better.,[]
You do not have to buy proprietary bags for the Champ.,[]
You can use any kind of trash bag.,[]
I really think it keeps the stink out.,[]
The only time we have smelly problems is when it's full and my husband needs to empty it and so we start laying the diapers next to it instead of inside it!,[]
The only negative thing I have to say about it is the latch to open.,[]
It's kind of hard.,[]
"I've torn fingernails more than once, that's why I have my husband do it now!",[]
I did like the Diaper Champ for the most part.,[]
I have been using it for 4 months and haven't had any odor problems since I use the glad odor lock bags.,[]
But it is difficult to open.,[]
I have broke more than one fingernail while opening it.,[]
It pops open so hard that sometimes it recloses itself.,[]
"On the upside I guess you would never have a problem with a child opening it.As an update, the seal came loose and now is impossible to use.",[]
I just checked and saw I am not the only one to have this problem.,[]
"My husband is trying to fix it, but at 4 months of use we should not be having this problem already.",[]
If I could change the rating I would to 2 stars.,[]
WOW!,[]
I'm very happy with my diaper champ!,[]
My baby is on formula and has pretty smelly poops!,[]
I have yet to detect any odor from my pail.,[]
"As to older baby poops, you are supposed to flush solid poops.",[]
No disposal system is designed to control older baby poops.,[]
"I have 2 diaper champs, one on each floor of my house, and NO smell.",[]
It is also very easy to use and cheap to refill.,[]
Buy this with confidence.,[]
I switched from the Genie to the Champ to avoid having to buy the cartridges.,[]
I like the flip over handle more than the twisting of the Genie.,[]
BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!,[]
"Not fun to go digging among diapers to retrieve toys, blocks, etc.I don't regret buying it - I still prefer it to the Genie.",[]
I believed everyone's great reviews for this item and put it on my registry.,[]
"To my dismay, this product is NOT a champ.",[]
"Yes, it may be economical because you use your own bags, but there's a flaw in the design.",[]
"Everytime you want to empty out the pail, you open up the lid to an open bag filled with all your dirty and SMELLY diapers.",[]
"Yes, the champ keeps the odor inside the pail but the bag mouth is open until you take it out of the pail (at which time the odors are all released) to tie it.",[]
I retured it and purchased the much contended Diaper Genie (...) to have a truly oderless room.,[]
"When our daughter was born we went and purchased a diaper genie, which was nothing but a hassle!!",[]
"We were taking out the diapers almost daily, it wasn't seeming to cut the odor, and it was a pain to empty and change the lining for the genie.",[]
"I went online and purchased the diaper champ, assuming it wouldn't probably help odor....but it would atleast be easier then the genie to change out!!",[]
Was I amazed!!,[]
"Keeps the odor in, super fast clean up, simple system, and best of all I don't have to send my husband out to get ""refills"" at 10 at night because we just realized that we were out of them!",[]
!,[]
I bought this with my first born for the same reason as everyone else listed.,[]
I didn't want to be committed to one type of bag that is more pricey than their worth.,[]
It was great!,[]
Held back the smell and there wasn't a continuous cost buying refills.The draw back came when after some time the foam seal that keeps the odor in where you deposit the diaper finally gave way and slid out of place making the whole thing rather useless.,"[('smell', 0.10549480957565062)]"
I am not sure if it was just mine or if it was a manufacture flaw.,[]
"Also, it was three years ago so maybe that isn't a problem anymore.I am contemplating trying it again for my second child because again, I don't want to have to buy special bags.-Sarah",[]
"I had tried a Diaper Genie at a friend's house and wasn't really impressed with how it worked, not to mention the idea of having to buy refills.",[]
"I registered for the Diaper Champ primarily because you could use regular kitchen trash bags instead of special refills, and all the good reviews it seemed to get.",[]
I could not be happier with the Champ!,[]
It is truly the easiet thing in the world to use--one hand is all you need.,[]
We have not noticed an odor problem at all.,[]
"Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.",[]
I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone having a baby!,[]
It is by far the best thing I received as a shower gift.,[]
You won't be disappointed in the Champ!,[]
This product was great for the first couple months.,[]
"It IS very easy to use, there's no twisting or struggling with the special bags, but when your little one starts foods and their mess gets a little more stinky, this pail does nothing to contain the odor.Here's the problem...there's no seal on the lid.",[]
"Where the lid opens to get the bags in and out, it's plastic against plastic that's not even remotely air tight that constantly leaks the stench of the inside.",[]
"Also, the chamber where you place the diaper gives you a waft of diaper pail air each time you flip it.I'm realistic that it IS a diaper pail and is it going to smell, but this product could do a much better job.",[]
"I DO empty mine at least once a week, wipe it with disinfecting wipes, spray it with lysol and let it air out for at least one day before it goes back in her room.",[]
"The problem is, you just can't get to all the surfaces in the top of the pail.",[]
"I spend more time struggling with this thing, cleaning it, and airing it out than is realistic.Save your money on this one.",[]
The cost of not having to buy the diaper genie bags is not worth smell in my little darling's nursery.,[]
I nannied for two babies in some one else's home and they have the Diaper Champ.,[]
I think the reason parents don't smell the diapers when using this product is because they get used to the smell!!,[]
I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house!,[]
"Finally, I had to start using the ""champ"" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can.",[]
"Although I'm sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!",[]
We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born.,[]
"We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ.",[]
The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child.,[]
"This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors.",[]
"We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products.",[]
"And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products.",[]
"So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months.",[]
We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags.,[]
And changing the Champ's bag is very easy.,[]
"But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable.",[]
"It really is true that babies' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids.",[]
"So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie, and are now very happy with the Genie.",[]
"The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.",[]
1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.,[]
"2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.",[]
The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.,[]
The hood and ordinary trash bags don't do much for odor prevention.,[]
"The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ's.",[]
We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.,[]
"I have had the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ, and the Champ is the Champ!",[]
"It is easier and simpler to use, plus more economical since it uses regular 13-gallon trash bags, making your refills cheap and convenient.I don't have a problem with odor unless I don't dump it every four days.",[]
Dump it and clean it regularly and you will never smell a thing.,[]
This may be in the top 5 items we have for our new baby.,[]
(1) We can use regular trash bags.,[]
(2) You cannot smell the diapers until you open to empty.,[]
(3) Only one hand is required to use.,[]
(4) You do not need a trash can for the nursery - this will work for that!HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!,[]
The best $30 you can spend!,[]
We have one on each floor of our home!,[]
We bought this because of the ease of using regular garbage bags and not being slaves to buying specific refills.,[]
It is very easy to dispose of the diaper and to change the bag when full.,[]
"As your baby does get older and onto table food, we have definately noticed an increased, ahem, odor.",[]
We now keep it in the garage and take the stinkies out there.,[]
Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.,[]
You can make it last a little longer if you cheat and put the urine diapers in the regular trash if it is changed frequently enough.,[]
This works for us because we don't go to the nursery changing table--we just flip him over on the living room floor now!,[]
I love the Diaper Champ!,[]
Everyone I knew had the Diaper Genie but had to buy expensive refills and did not like all the twisting involved.,[]
"After reading reviews of the Diaper Champ, I put it on my baby registry and I am glad I did.",[]
"It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.",[]
"Also, be sure the tabs on soiled diapers are secured to the diaper or they will get stuck up under the cylinder on the way down.",[]
This diaper pail is great.,[]
"No expensive refill bags to buy, it uses any kitchen trash bag.",[]
No smell and its easy to use - even one handed!,[]
It is worth the money!,[]
Friends and family told me not to get a diaper pail- they don't work everyone said- I am so glad I didn't listen to them!,[]
I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
You can't tell that there are dirty diapers in it.,[]
"When I change the bag, I always spray it with Lysol and that does the job for any bad odor I smell while changing it.",[]
It is easy to change bags.,[]
"It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.",[]
"Wonderful product, I highly recommend buying it.",[]
We registered for the diaper champ after comparing it with the diaper genie and diaper dekor at the store.,[]
We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.,[]
"Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.",[]
"It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn't yet.",[]
"We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.",[]
I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.,[]
We love this diaper pail!,[]
The design is so cool!,[]
You don't even have to open it to put a dirty diaper in it!,[]
The only design flaw is when you have to change the bag.,[]
The bag is not sealed when you open the pail to change it so it really stinks.,[]
"Other than that, we have had no odor problems.",[]
And for right now the pail is in our bedroom so we would notice an odor if there was one!,[]
Plus it uses regular kitchen bags and not expensive refills like other pails (the selling point for us!,[]
).,[]
I love this diaper pail!,[]
It's so easy to use and I haven't had any problems with diaper odors.,[]
I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.,[]
Save yourself some money and hassle and buy the Diaper Champ!,[]
My husband and I decided to buy this because we did not want to be tied down to any expensive refills.,[]
We are very happy with our decision.,[]
"It is odorless, easy to operate and holds good amount of diapers.",[]
"Not wanting to have to buy all those bags for the diaper genie, we opted for the champ.",[]
"So far, we're quite happy with it.",[]
"In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.",[]
My only complaint is that I wish it held more.,[]
It seems like it gets filled up so quickly (that could just be the enormous amount of diapers a baby goes through!,[]
)I love the fact that it uses regular trash bags and there has been no smell that we can notice.,[]
We've recommended it to all our expecting friends.,[]
"I was torn between the Diaper Champ and the ""other"" well know diaper pail.",[]
I'm so happy that I decided on the Champ.,[]
"It is great - holds LOTS of diapers, doesn't require any expensive refills.",[]
I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.,[]
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,[]
!,[]
I agree with the previous reviews.,[]
"However, I wanted to add that the diaper champ has a two blue knobs on the side that are meant to be moved to remove the upper part.",[]
This way you can clean it in case it gets dirty but it's so hard to put back together that I wouldn't remove it.,[]
If it gets dirty just clean around it.,[]
I took it apart and had to play around with it for days to get it attached again.,[]
Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.,[]
"I would definitely recommend choosing the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie, since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive Genie refills.",[]
Definitely reduces the odor (just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag!!!),[]
and is easy to clean.,[]
Love it!!,[]
!,[]
"I received the more well-known diaper pail for my baby shower, even after registering for the Diaper Champ.",[]
"I thought I would give the other one a chance, but after taking it out of the box and fiddling around with it for a while, I returned it for the Diaper Champ within a week.",[]
"The Diaper Champ is bigger/taller which makes it more convenient to use, and it is so easy to setup and its more attractive!",[]
"Not as many special switches and clips, and no cartridges that are difficult to change and operate.",[]
It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.,[]
I recommend this one to anybody.,[]
We received the diaper champ as a gift and when my daughter was a newborn and it worked just fine...then she got bigger and so did her diapers.,[]
They were constantly getting jammed in the chute.,[]
And now that she is on solids it is not keeping the odors in at all.,[]
Every time we flip the handle we get a huge wiff of dirty diapers.,[]
So needless to say we are not using this anymore.,[]
It's great for newborns but not for older babies.,[]
The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.,[]
This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).,[]
"I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!",[]
Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.,[]
Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.,[]
"And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.",[]
"The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.",[]
"If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.",[]
Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.,[]
Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!,[]
What I like about this product is that you don't need special bags - a definite money saver.,[]
It keeps out odors and it is easy to use.,[]
This diaper pail is a wonderful invention for parents.,[]
It's far better than all others on the market...it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.,[]
My husband and I love this product.,[]
"Several friends of ours recommended it, and I'm so happy that we purchased it.",[]
"It's large enough to hold many diapers, and it really does keep our nursery odor-free.",[]
I really like that we don't need to purchase expensive bags to use with it.,[]
We just use regular kitchen garbage bags.,[]
"My sister had the Diaper Genie, which is tough to use and too small.",[]
This product is much better.,[]
"We had the genie for our first child, and we thought it was pretty good.",[]
"However, the special refills were annoying to buy and keep on-hand... and changing it was difficult.The Diaper Champ is a real champ.",[]
"The wide mouth accepts those nasty smelling incoming diapers and with a flip of the handle, they're gone.",[]
"We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.",[]
"If you have 2 under 2, those smelly toddler diapers can go right in with the baby's... and you won't need a gas mask, even if you don't empty it for a day or two.",[]
This diaper pail is a wonderful investment.,[]
While other diaper pails require the use of thier own bags this pail uses any bag...including old shopping bags.,[]
This save alot of money.,[]
When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.,[]
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.,[]
When our church tossed Diaper Genies because they were old & discontinued that model they bought this.,[]
At the time I just watched & smelled to see how it would hold up in a high-use environment.,[]
The nursery has never smelled better.,[]
With simple cleaning and disinfecting (as often as weekly or as infrequent as monthly!!),[]
the odors are non-existent to minimal.,[]
I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.,[]
I have been so happy with the use of regular household garbage liners and the hands-free approach that I recommend this to anyone I see considering it.Only possible downside is for those with sensitive noses or a sick child - it may need to be changed more than weekly or use a stronger cleaner than what I'm using...,[]
We also wanted the diaper champ instead of the Genie because...who wants to buy special bags??,[]
It is a life saver to just throw in a kitchen garbage bag.,[]
"We ended up receiving ours as a hand-me-down, and I was worried that it would smell.",[]
Surprisingly enough - it only starts to smell when it's time to change the bag.,[]
"And sure enough, the lid would start ""sticking"" right about that time, which told me that the bag was full and it was time to change it (instead of struggling to stuff another couple diapers in).",[]
"Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.",[]
"Just keep some Lysol wipes by the changing table, and wipe it down if you get anything anywhere.",[]
Piece of cake.,[]
I purchased the diaper champ because I liked the idea of using regular trash bags.,[]
I read the reviews and thought it was a good product.,[]
"At first, it was great.",[]
I would occasionally need to pick it up and drop it hard to get the stopper to drop but that was all the trouble I had.,[]
"When it came to emptying the champ, it was all I could do not to add my own biological contents inside the bag.",[]
"Once my son grew to 3 months and was producing smellier diapers, the thing began to stink.",[]
We would empty the champ at least every 3 days and it didn't help.,[]
I just went out and bought the diaper genie and I LOVE it!,[]
What a cool idea to never have to touch the diapers after disposal.,[]
"I used a Diaper Genie with my first baby and it was alright, but I hated pushing the diapers down, cutting the bag when it was full, putting the little-sausage-like-string of diapers in another bag and always running out of refills.A friend of mine had a Diaper Champ and I loved it.",[]
I bought one when my second baby came and I'm a believer.,[]
It's so easy!!,[]
Just drop the diaper and flip the lid!,[]
"No pushing diapers down, no using special bags (it takes any ordinary trash bag!)",[]
VERY EASY to empty!,[]
"Its so easy, my 3 year old loves making his brother's diapers disappear.",[]
"I just drop the dirty one in and he flips the lid, I don't have to worry about his hands getting dirty or anything!",[]
!I've never had a problem with smell.,[]
The lid comes apart easily for when it does need cleaned.,[]
I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!,[]
I definitly recommend this product from experience!,[]
I love this diaper disposal system.,[]
I had the diaper genie with my first son.,[]
"It was difficult to operate, plus you had to buy the expensive refills.",[]
"With the diaper champ, I just use my regular garbage bags (13 gallon glad quick ties).",[]
The unit is very simple to use.,[]
You just stick the diaper in and flip the handle over.I haven't had any trouble opening the unit to change the bags.,[]
I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.,[]
I highly recommend this product.,[]
"Before the birth of my first child, I bought the Diaper Genie and HATED IT!",[]
"It held a *minimal* amount of diapers, it did NOT contain odors, and needed special bags (which were difficult to cut and remove).",[]
"After approximately 2 months, I bought the Diaper Champ(!)",[]
&amp; I LOVE IT.,[]
It is now my staple baby shower gift for all my prego-friends!,[]
"It is SO simple to use, holds MANY diapers, uses regular kitchen garbage bags (or even plastic grocery bags!",[]
"), and NEVER smells.",[]
I cannot say enough about it - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,[]
!,[]
I just wanted to say that I love my Diaper Champ (I use it with my Fuzzi Bunz cloth diapers) and I have never had a problem with smell.,[]
I think it also makes a big difference whether or not you breastfeed or artificially feed.,[]
I only breastfeed so I never have a problem.,[]
"I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.",[]
"For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.",[]
The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.,[]
"All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.",[]
This is great and much better than the Genie.,[]
You can use regular bags instead of special ones.,[]
You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.,[]
One of the most practical and useful items that I received for my shower and would definitely recommend to new moms and dads.,[]
I purchased this diaper pail after using the Diaper Dekor for about two years with my first son.,[]
"It required special bags, and it tore up pretty easily, resulting in a smelly diaper pail.",[]
"Expecting another child, I decided to replace it with the Diaper Champ, and have been extremely pleased with it!",[]
"No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.",[]
I highly recommend it!,[]
I absolutely hate this thing.,[]
First all the little hole on top is too small for all but the tiniest newborn diapers.,[]
"So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.",[]
Then you cram it in the tiny little hole and poop inevitably gets all over the hole.,[]
"And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.",[]
"So, yes, you need to take out the diaper and wriggle the handle.",[]
"All this defeats the purpose of having a ""hands-free"" diaper pail!",[]
"Get a regular old trash can with a pedal on the front, stick in a air-freshener, and save yourself some time and money.",[]
Add us to the list of Diaper Champ fans.,[]
"We keep it in our hallway with the changing table and there is no diaper odor in our house, even standing right over it or emptying it.",[]
It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.,[]
"Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.",[]
Why have the cost and inconvenience of buying refill liners if you don't have to?,[]
Hands down winner!,[]
"The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.",[]
"My only advice is to be sure you wad the diaper and use the tapes to keep it shut, or the tape can get caught in the tube.",[]
(This is true with other diaper pails too.),[]
"Anyway, it's a better price and a better product.",[]
Get it!,[]
"We bought the diaper champ, because we heard all the others where over priced, espeically with the refills.",[]
We liked how with the this diaper pail you could just use regular trash bags.,[]
"It worked very well and we where very happy with our purchase until it started to get warmer out, and our son started to eat foods.",[]
It smells!,[]
We keep it in our son's closet with an air freshiner in it!,[]
"It's good while they are young, right now i think any trash can would do the same.",[]
I have to agree with the other moms.,[]
"At first the Diaper Champ was a champ, until I had to change the bag.",[]
"It is difficult to open, not to mention everytime I did change the bag my nails would break (and I don't have long ones).",[]
"My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks.",[]
"Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room.",[]
It penetrated into the room.,[]
"Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside.",[]
I was changing the bag on an every day basis.,[]
This is by far the worst product out there.,[]
"Take my word for it when I say, I rather take the walk and dump the diaper outside than have to use the Diaper Champ ever again.",[]
I wanted a diaper pail that didn't stink.,[]
"I'd heard from *everyone* I knew that had purchased a Diaper Genie to not bother looking, nothing out there stopped the stink.",[]
"Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!",[]
I found this Diaper Champ - no refills - a definite plus - you just use your regular kitchen garbage bags.,[]
"Convenient, and less costly!But the big question is - did it work?",[]
Did it keep the stink out of my baby's room??,[]
"I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!",[]
"It works!Now, if you hover right above the opening and inhale deeply, you will catch a whiff of poo.",[]
But who does that??,[]
Sceptical friends who had owned the Diaper Genie (the ones who swore nothing would work!),[]
"were thrilled and a little jealous that this thing works so well!I've never had an issue with ""skid marks"" as another reviewer posted - 11 months, skid free so far.",[]
"I have had a seal loosen, as another reviewer mentioned, but as he said - it has not affected the odor prevention of this.Word of warning - it works so well that you will not be prepared for the odor you will get when you open this to change the bag.",[]
Hold your breath!,[]
!,[]
This diaper pail is one of my favorite and essential baby items.,[]
I have had no odor problems whatsoever!,[]
It's so easy to use and takes only regular trashbags.,[]
You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.,[]
I highly recommend this to new moms and also to moms who aren't happy with their current product.,[]
They will not regret it.,[]
"Love it, love it, love it!",[]
I love that you can use regular plastic bags and don't need to buy refills for it.,[]
Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there.,[]
Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes.,[]
My daughter is starting potty training and I'm still using it.,[]
Great buy!,[]
This is the best thing ever.,[]
Easy to use and no need to buy expensive refills.,[]
I bought cheap trash bags and only have to replace it every 3-4 days.,[]
I also bought a stick up and placed inside so when I changed the bag the smell wasn't so bad.,[]
This is definately a product I would tell everyone to buy.,[]
The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.,[]
"(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.",[]
")And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink.",[]
"I now have two of these, one for my 2 year old (almost 3 yrs.)",[]
and one for my newborn.,[]
They are far better than the Diaper Genie!,[]
"(Several friends of mine have the Genie, which I've used on a number of occasions.",[]
")For wet diapers we just put it in there, spin the top over, and it's gone.",[]
"For poopy diapers, we usually just stick the diaper in a a plastic grocery bag, spin the top of the bag, and then put it in the Diaper Champ.",[]
You don't need to buy a special bag or series of bags made by the manufacturer.,[]
The Champ is THE product to get!,[]
"Really, don't get the Genie - what a pain having that.",[]
We bought this for our first son and now its being used for our second.,[]
"I cant count the money it has saved us, since you can use our own garbage sacks.",[]
When my first son got older I noticed a little odor escaping-the key is when you empty it wipe it down with cleaner or a wet wipe (My mother informed me you are supposed to do this anyway)that keeps the smell from building and escaping and it has worked like a charm.,[]
I have a 2 1/2 yr old and a 4 month old.,[]
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.,[]
"There are good/bad things about it compaired to the Diaper Genie but I think we like the Diaper Genie the best - GOOD about Champ: you don't need special inserts, just normal garbage bags.",[]
BAD: you can't just shove a dirty diaper into it like you can the diaper genie.,[]
You have to wrap the diaper up nice and clean and then put it into the shoot.,[]
I love being able to grab the dirty diaper from the clean end and shoving it into the diaper genie and then closing it up.,[]
Sometimes the diapers are just too messy to wrap up nice.,[]
I also think the diaper genie surprisingly holds more and it doesn't smell as bad as the diaper champ.,[]
I was laughing thinking that the diaper champ doesn't hold that much but thank god it doesn't 'cause it would smell so bad if you didn't change it a lot!,[]
We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.,[]
I really think whatever you use first - you get used to.,[]
They both do the job :),[]
I do not recommend this product at all.,[]
It doesn't lock odor in and it gets stuck & jammed.,[]
I strongly regret not having registered for the Diaper Genie.,[]
I am one of those super-critical shoppers who researches everything about a product and then second-guesses purchase decisions...but I love this diaper pail.,[]
I was completely satisfied with my purchase and even bought a second one for our upstairs bedroom.,[]
*It really is cost effective.,[]
You don't have to spend money on refill bags.,[]
I just use the pastic ones from the grocery store.,[]
They work perfectly.,[]
"*It is so easy to use, so easy to change.",[]
I tried another brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no.,[]
You should spend zero time disposing of diapers and all your time with your new baby.,[]
The Diaper Champ is effortless.,[]
*It effectively keeps the room from smelling like dirty diapers.,[]
I live where it is hot and humid and don't have central air so smell containment is important.,[]
It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.,[]
Scented bags makes the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensitive nose.,[]
"*At first I was turned off by the look of the diaper pail, but I have come to appreciate its design.",[]
"I bought and tried out a different one and found that the Diaper Champ is taller (about 27"" high) and narrower.",[]
This means that it takes up less floor space but still holds quite a few diapers (I empty it every 2-3 days).,[]
"Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.",[]
*A small but considerate detail--there is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you change the bag.,[]
This along with the way the weight is centered in the design makes it so the whole thing doesn't fall over when you open it to change the bag.,[]
The other brand I had tried kept falling over when I tried to change the bag and it was incredibly frustrating.,[]
*The only thing against the product I would mention is the noise.,[]
"It makes a ""thunk"" when you dispose a diaper into the pail.",[]
I don't mind it during the day--it's actually kind of fun to use.,[]
"But during night-time changings you have to flip the handle a little slower so it doesn't make a noise.Anyways, I hope this helps.",[]
"After having a Diaper Genie and then seeing my Champ, my sister in law went out and bought one.",[]
She's very glad she did!,[]
"It's easy to use, no special bags to buy, no smells that we have noticed so far.",[]
Since I've never used any other diaper pail I can't compare but I am very happy with this one.,[]
Of course I wish it held 100 diapers so I didn't have to change the bag :)  changing it is easy.,[]
Only small problems is when it starts to get full you have to sometimes push down the weight thing to fit in a few more diapers.,[]
That's it.,[]
My only small complaint.,[]
I love this thing!,[]
I don't notice any smell while top shut.,[]
"It is simple to use, simple to clean.",[]
"The top does jam when the bag is full, but what else would you expect.",[]
I like that because then I know its time to change the bag.I don't know what I would do without this thing!,[]
We opted for the Diaper Champ because of its ease of use and the ability to use regular garbage bags to dispose of diapers.,[]
We are happy with those chcracteristics of the Champ.,[]
"However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.",[]
"One trick we use that seems to keep the odor away is to put a piece of charcoal at the bottom of the bin when you change the bag, and that absorbs the odors.",[]
"Because of how easy it is, we would recommend it.",[]
"This diaper pail is easy to use, with the greatest benefit being NO SPECIAL BAGS.",[]
This saves money!!!,[]
"I have not noticed any odor problems as others mentioned, but would say that the latch to open it is a bit tough.",[]
"Since this is only necessary when changing bags, I do not mind this minor flaw.",[]
It is also easy to clean and it slender shape hides nicely behind a door or in the corner.,[]
I have had the Diaper Champ in my son's room for 6 months and all of a sudden the room smells like dirty diapers all the time.,[]
The smell is starting to linger down the hall.,[]
"I cleaned the diaper champ, let it air out over night and then sprayed it with lysol and it is still stinking up the room!",[]
I have two of these that I bought before the birth of my son.,[]
"They are great means for diaper disposal trapping odor, mess, etc.",[]
"I think they have it way over the competition, though, because you can use any old garbage bag from the grocery store.",[]
You can even use the scented bags if you choose.,[]
I can't imagine running out of the special bags needed for the diaper genie and then making sure I got myself to a store that sold them.,[]
You really need ease of use and convenience when you have a newborn and this product really made life with baby alot easier!,[]
"It's easy to dispense of the diaper, easy to change the bag, easy to clean!",[]
I love this product!,[]
"The fact that you don't need proprietary bags was a plus for me, but once we started using it for my baby girl's diapers, I was pleased to find it did not let ANY odors escape!",[]
"I change the bag twice a week, just because it fills up pretty fast, but even the couple of times I forgot and only changed it once that week, there was still no odor leakage.",[]
The real challenge for this product will be in a couple of months when my breastfed baby starts on some solids.,[]
"But until then, I can only say we are thrilled with the quality of the Diaper Champ!",[]
I registered for the Diaper Champ mostly because I did not want to have to buy refill containers like in the Diaper Genie.,[]
"That seems silly  to me - diapers are already an expense as it is, why have to buy refills to dispose of those diapers as well?",[]
"Plus, a friend had so many problems with her Diaper Genie - it broke 3 times, and when it did work, she went through the refill containers so fast, and there was times she didn't have refill containers on hand.My son is almost 3 months old now, and we absolutely love the Diaper Champ.",[]
We have ZERO odor.,[]
"We love that it takes regular trash bags - I bought a box of tall kitchen bags at GIANT supermarket, it cost me like 2 dollars, and I got 60 bags.",[]
"We change the bag about every 5 days when its full, which every 5 days is not bad at all!",[]
"(Again, so much cheaper than Diaper Genie Refills)It is so easy to use - fold up your diaper as compact as you can (saves space in the bag) and put in tube and flip the handle.",[]
"Simple, simple!It starts getting hard to flip the handle when the bag is full.",[]
You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.,[]
"I appreciate this because the first hard flip is a warning the bag must be changed soon.Like other reviewers mentioned, every so often give the pail a good scrub and disinfect.",[]
But absolutely never an odor problem.,[]
"I highly recommend this product to all my friends who are about to have babies!7/11/05 Update:  Now that my son is 6 months old and has been eating solid foods for 2 months, which of course means MUCH stinkier diapers, this diaper pail is still a dream!!","[('months', 0.1386440349499996)]"
"Durable, and ABSOLUTELY no odor, only when we have to open the thing up to change the bag.",[]
Its unbelievable how there is no smell.,[]
This is one of those few things I would say is a must to any new parent.,[]
Worth every penny of $30.,[]
"I would pay double for the thing, it is that great.",[]
Dh and I loved this pail until we went up to the first size of 4X8X4 cloth diapers.,[]
"They were too big for the drum to turn effectively, and the diapers often got stuck.",[]
We tossed it and bought a plain old pail.,[]
I suppose it could also be a problem with the last two sizes of disposables.,[]
We were originally not planning to buy or register for a diaper pail until we saw this one on a friend's registry.,[]
I was interested in it since it uses regular garbage bags.,[]
Let me tell you...it is WONDERFUL!!!,[]
You don't realize how great the odor control is until you change the bag and wow does it work well!!,[]
"Easy to use, eliminates odor, uses regular bags, affordable.......I highly recommend it!",[]
!,[]
I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
"The design makes it so easy to use, and it is wonderful to not have to buy expensive refills.",[]
"Someone bought us the Diaper Champ off of our registry, and someone else bought us the Diaper Genie.",[]
The Genie went back the next day.,[]
"I can't see having to use two hands to use it, and pay extra for glorified garbage bags.",[]
I love this product.,[]
"This product received a high rating by this site and others; however, it does not live up to those ratings and expectations.",[]
It does not seal out odors effectively.,[]
"Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.",[]
"We recently decided to move it into the bathroom; however, the odor was just unbearable.We would not recommend this product to anyone.",[]
We just purchased the Diaper Genie based on positive feedback from our friends.Diaper Champ is going to the dump first thing in the morning...Buyer Beware!,[]
"We have been using a d. champ for nearly four years now - it has been very convenient, easy to use, and as close to odorless as one could reasonably hope.",[]
"We bought it for our son, and when his little sister was born, we bought a different one because the store we were in didn't have a champ.",[]
"When my son learned to use the toilet, we got rid of the new one and moved the champ into my daughter's room.",[]
My niece said she loves the Diaper Champ that I bought her for her shower.,[]
She said it is very easy to use.,[]
I bought this for the pre-school I teach at and it works wonders!,[]
No more poo smell!,[]
"And when you have 14 kids who are all about 2 years old and are there 8 hours a day, its a life saver.",[]
"The only bad things about it are easily correctable (If I can do it with 14 kids, most poeple can do it with 1).",[]
"First of all, it only takes diapers and wipes.",[]
Nothing else or it gets stuck.,[]
"If it does get stuck, it is easy to fix.",[]
Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out.,[]
"Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.",[]
Simply tell them that it is NOT A TOY and is for teachers (or parents) only.,[]
"I had read all the reviews for this item, and was very excited to receive it as a shower gift.",[]
"However, when I started to assemble the base, I realized that this doesn't seem to be all that it is cracked up to be.",[]
"Firstly, to attach the base (which I didn't understand, why it isn't assembled for you), you must turn the unit upside down and screw it in.",[]
"Not so difficult, but since the top isn't level, it is a bit difficult.",[]
"Moving on, to actually opening the unit.",[]
"I know this is very vain, but I found it very difficult to actually open the unit (I kept breaking a nail every time I opened it).",[]
"Albeit, very vain, but why is it so difficult to open?",[]
"Then, I was disappointed to find out that there is no scent or anything, so how does it really hide odors?",[]
My husband wondered what the difference there is between this and a regular trash can.,[]
I think we will return it for the Diaper Genie.,[]
All I have to say is that I'm glad I opened it before the baby comes.,[]
The only two concepts for a diaper pail are currently the diaper champ and the diaper genie.,[]
Obviously they both have their admirers and detractors - but the real question is can the pail be used for anything other than diapers?The diaper champ clearly wins out in that regard.,[]
"What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?",[]
"They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.",[]
"I put some baking soda and a sheet of BOUNCE (hint, hint) in the champ below the plastic bag - the smell was gone.All in all - the only reason I don't give five stars is because 13 gallon kitchen bags are just a touch too big for the container, and shopping bags from the supermarket are just too small.","[('bags', 0.13685284542644133)]"
If there was a 7 or 10 gallon bag - that might be perfect.,[]
I purchased this  item after I read reviews.,[]
It works wonderful with no smell and no refills ( No headaches ).,[]
we should empty this item only when we are ready to throw the used diapers bag else it may smell.,[]
"This is small bargain when compared with refills, which still smell",[]
"We heard bad stories about the diaper genie and decided to go on a recommendation for the ""Champ.""",[]
"Boy, are we glad we listened.",[]
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.,[]
Definitely worth the investment and very easy to use - especially in the middle of the night.,[]
I had the diaper genie for 14 months and just got tired of buying all those refills and just couldnt hanldle the smell anymore.,[]
I finally decide its time for a switch.,[]
I checked out all the diapers pails aviliable and decided on the diaper champ as it was rated the best.,[]
I have had it for over a month and no smell.,[]
I just love it not to mention the more expensive refills.,[]
I read all the reveiws good and bad(only a few) and just made sure to put the babywipes in the diaper and make sure theres no poop ozing from the sides before i throw in the diaper champ.,[]
I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.,[]
Besides who wants to wipe up poop regardless of what diaper pail you own.,[]
Its bad enough we have to smell it during a diaper change and trust me it isnt pleasant.I love the no fuss turn the handle and the diaper is gone.,[]
no opening a lid and getting slapped with poop odor.,[]
i give the diaper champ 5 stars and will buy the champ for a baby shower i have coming up.,[]
I dont have any problems with the latch.,[]
Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.,[]
So if your planning on a diaper pail i say get the Champ and you will be very pleased.,[]
I have two Diaper Champs and I love them!,[]
"First of all, with three babies, the last thing I need is to worry about special bags.",[]
"Secondly, this thing is so easy to use!",[]
I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.,[]
You get a sense for when it's getting full if the plunger doesn't go down easily - though diapers still go in if that's not a convenient time to change the bag.,[]
"I change the bag about every day or two (as I said, I have two, so the diapers are split between the two) and rarely have any odor at all.",[]
"If I do, it's minor, and it's because the lesser-used one hasn't been changed in a while.",[]
"It's easy to change the bag, and if there did get a small smell, I wipe it down with one of those Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and presto, all better!",[]
There are very few surfaces that come in contact with a diaper and it's very easy to clean.,[]
"Believe me, any product that is not easy to use gets chucked quickly in my house!",[]
And I would buy the Diaper Champ again in a second.,[]
LOVE IT!,[]
"The Diaper Champ by Baby Trend has great ergonomics, convinience and attractive looks.",[]
The flipping of the handle causes the piston to dispense the dirty diaper into any medium sized kitchen trash bag.,[]
"When the piston does not shove the diaper into the trash bag, you know it's time to dispose the trash bag without having to investigate - normally a smelly chore...",[]
The initial price of $... will be just that - without having to buy a vendor specific daiper/waste bag.,[]
It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).,[]
I will recommend this product to anyone in need of a diaper pail.,[]
"I thought the idea of keeping dirty diapers in the house was just gross, so I decided to make 20 trips a day to the trash.",[]
"Boy, was I misguided in my thinking,because this diaper champ is a Godsend!",[]
You really do not smell a thing!,[]
"I heard the diaper genie was a huge mess, so I did not even attempt to buy it.",[]
Get this and limit those trips out to the trash!,[]
I love this product.,[]
It is so easy to use and there are no refills.,[]
I can use any kind of kitchen bag.,[]
"There is a smell of course when you change the bag, but it is no big deal, it is just until you tie up the bag.",[]
We first had the genie.,[]
It was a PAIN.,[]
Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so...it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.,[]
THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.,[]
For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.,[]
I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.,[]
"My daughter is about to turn 2 and I am starting to potty train her, so it is time to sell my Diaper Champ at our next yard sale.",[]
"I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.",[]
"After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.",[]
"Do not buy this if you are looking to avoid diaper smell--you will probably be disappointed, especially since this product costs about $30.",[]
What I'm currently doing is what other reviewers have said--I just put the dirty diapers in with the kitchen garbage since that gets taken out frequently.,[]
"(No, my kitchen garbage is not actually in the kitchen, it's on the other side of a safety gate in the adjoining laundry room.",[]
Those of you with toddlers understand I'm sure.,[]
)You know what IS nice about this diaper pail though?,[]
It keeps your kid out of the dirty diapers.,[]
"When my daughter started getting into everything, at least I didn't have to worry about her getting into the nasty diapers and doing anything with them.I don't think this product is worth $30.",[]
It's essentially a plastic garbage can with a nifty lid.,[]
It should probably cost half what it does.,[]
"If you get this, try using the plastic grocery store bags and taking them out more often.I want to add one last thing for those parents that don't know--a lot of parents aren't emptying poo from diapers into the toilet before throwing away the disposable diaper.",[]
"This is something you are supposed to do, not just for cloth diapers.",[]
"That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.",[]
"I realize this takes some of the convenience out of it being a disposable diaper, but it is something we all need to be doing.",[]
It'll also help cut down on the diaper stink of course.,[]
This thing doesn't work very well.,[]
It still smells up the room.,[]
"I've found the only way to not have smelly diapers around is to throw them in a grocery bag, tie it up and put it outside.",[]
It's cheaper too.,[]
We have used our diaper champ for the last 7 months and it is great.,[]
"It doesn't stink, it is easy to change bags, and you can use any bags you like.",[]
I use our standard kitchen garbage bags.,[]
I have tried the diaper genie and hated it.,[]
We've used this diaper pail for a year now and have had NO problems!,[]
"The fact that you can use any medium garbage bag or even a used plastic grocery bag is just great, convenient and inexpensive too.",[]
"We have had NO problems with smells because we always empty the ""poopy"" diapers in the toilet before folding them up tightly and discarding them in the Champ.",[]
The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.,[]
"Even then, though, you can usually open the unit, shake the bag a bit and make yourself some more room.",[]
"Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.",[]
It was worth every penny and if you empty your dirty diapers before discarding them you shouldn't have to disinfect it like some of the reviewers here have had to do to get rid of the odors.,[]
Much better than the Genie anyday!!!!!,[]
!,[]
"The customer service rep at the store told us that this was the best selling diaper pail, even over the diaper genie, and now I can see why!",[]
It's easy to use- I can put a diaper in this unit with one hand while keeping a hold of my baby in the other.,[]
"Also, I bought a megabox of the inexpensive trash kitchen liners ($8 for 5000) and I haven't even gone through 1/4 of them and I've been using this for 6 1/2 months!",[]
Definitely a money saver there compared to the diaper genie!,[]
"And I don't smell any odors while the pail is closed, just when I open it to take the liner out!",[]
Great pail that's easy and cheap to use!,[]
This product is nice in theory but not all that its cracked up to be.,[]
"The foam lining comes out after several months of use (this happened to 3 other people I know too), and it does nothing to stop odor.",[]
"(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).",[]
Save your money and buy something else - this champs a chump.,[]
"I would agree with a previous reviewer, Matthew.",[]
While the bags are cheaper because you can use your existing trash bags.,[]
"The assault on your nose when you go to empty it almost blows you over, paticularly if its the summer and the room its in doesn't have AC.",[]
"When we would empty it - we would take it outside first and then leave it oustide, open overnight.",[]
Not worth the savings in bags.,[]
I've had the Diaper Genie (took it back to the store) and the Diaper Champ and I know the Champ is better.,[]
I love the flip over action.,[]
Once the diaper is in the hole it doesn't fall out and it is in the trash.,[]
My daughter loves to put her brother's dirty diapers in it.,[]
"If you use those individual scented diapers sacks, minimum smells!",[]
After reading the reviews for this product.,[]
I addedthe diaper champ to my baby registry.,[]
This diaperpail is a MUST have.,[]
I have one in our master bedroombecause it does it's job of keeping the odor withinthe container.,[]
"I ask everyone who steps inside ourroom if they smell traces of dirty diapers and everyonehas said no :) It's strange, but my 4 year old son lovesto help throw away diapers whenever I change our newborn.I previously owned the Diaper Genie, which I reallydisliked because 1. the pricey refills 2. the plasticrefills had a perfume scent to mask the odors and whenthe two mixed (smell of dirty diapers and the perfume)it made me want to vomit.","[('steps', 0.07724687716933615)]"
3,[]
I didn't like stuffing myhands down to shove the diaper in 4.,[]
When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.,[]
"And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.",[]
Take my word for it and don't wasteyour money or time with the other diaper pails.,[]
One ofthe best investments and inventions.,[]
"Because it's easyand fun (you'll see why)to use, doesn't need costlyrefills just use your own kitchen garbage bags, andit's also baby proof (an important factor when yourbaby starts crawling and getting curious.",[]
GREAT BUY!!,[]
!,[]
I love my diaper champ!,[]
It takes regular trash bags rather than expensive refills.,[]
It is also extremely simple to operate.,[]
"My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.",[]
"However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.",[]
I highly recommend this item.,[]
This is one of my favorite baby gifts!!,[]
I have no smells.,[]
I use scented trash bags and a stick-up.,[]
I wash it every few weeks.,[]
I bought the diaper champ because I did not want to bother with refills (like the diaper genie uses) - you can use any plastic shopping bag with handles.,[]
"I have been pleased with how well it functions, but it does have to be emptied quite frequently because there are definate odors that it cannot contain!",[]
"I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!",[]
"However, if you want to save money by not getting refills, this is the diaper pail for you.",[]
"Got this for my baby shower, after reading all the reviews.",[]
I have never had a problem with mine.,[]
"I uses odor controlling garbage bags, and you never smell any dirty diapers.This product is great!",[]
I bought 1 diaper genie and 1 diaper champ.,[]
The Genie was tried several times throughout the year and each time was stuck back in the closet.,[]
I read several reviews and help guides and just couldn't get the thing to work without the bags tearing.,[]
"It was a lot of work, basically, to get it to function.",[]
"When I got it to function, it was satisfactory in stopping diaper smell.",[]
"But it was a ton of trouble to function.In contrast, the Diaper Champ was simple to use and simple to clean.",[]
"It could be done with 1 hand (so you can hold on to the baby at the same time), whereas the Genie needs 2.",[]
It needs to have its bags changed out less often than the Genie because it stops the smell very well.,[]
"(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.",[]
Save yourself a step and just get the Diaper Champ.,[]
It does contain most of the odors but not all.,[]
It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures.,[]
It will save you money on refills so that's a plus.,[]
"I really love this product, it really does everything that it  claims.",[]
My son is 7 months old and we have been using the Diaper champ from day one.,[]
"No odour so far, it only smells when u open the champ to change the bag.",[]
"Now come on, what more do u expect from a pile of soiled diapers !Its expensive than the diaper genie, but worth every extra penny I paid.",[]
I love my Diaper Champ.,[]
It is easy to deposit diapers with one hand.,[]
I do get some slight odor but this is only when I don't empty it frequent enough.,[]
"When I put a new bag in, I put about 1/4 cup of Arm and Hammer carpet fresh in the bottom.",[]
This seems to help keep the odor from the diapers to absorb into the plastic container.,[]
Frequent washing also helps.,[]
I sometime have a bit of trouble getting it open to remove the bag but this is not enough to make me want to get a different brand.,[]
Very satisfied.,[]
We bought the Diaper Champ with our 1st child and used it until we had another child.,[]
It was great while he was being breast fed and wasn't that stinky but as he got older and ate a more varied diet it just stopped containing the smell.,[]
We changed the bags and wiped it out every few days and used lots of Lysol and it still smelled.,[]
Also after a while the cylinder that pushes the diaper down started to slide too far and get stuck and then it became a huge pain the drop a diaper in.,[]
"Half the time you would have to tip the whole pail over or open the top to get a new diaper in.With our second child we bought the NEAT by saftey first, she is now a year and we LOVE it.",[]
It even contained the smell of our older childs diapers before potty training.,[]
"As the mother of an obese child who has a great affinity for all things edible, I felt great relief when the ""Diaper Champ"" arrived on my front doorstep.",[]
"Removing it from the box, I felt as if I were in a dream!",[]
It was so new...so clean...so glimmering white!,[]
I hustled it upstairs and set it up next to Jane-Bob(my baby girl)'s changing table.,[]
I didn't have to wait long before I was provided with a fresh offering.,[]
I bundled up the heavily laden diaper and hauled it into the Diaper Champ.,[]
Alas!,[]
"With a great roar, the Diaper Champ clogged and sprayed back at me.",[]
It took me weeks to clean that room...Don't get it!,[]
It clogs!,[]
"And when it does, you'll be sorry!Quaddie, your friendly advisor!",[]
"When I registered for this product, I did so based on price.",[]
It was the best decision!,[]
This is a fantastic product.,[]
"As a mom of multiples, I have to change the bag every day.",[]
"The Diaper Champ doesn't use ""special"" bags.",[]
You can use any 'ol garbage bag and that has definitely saved us money over the diapering pails that require you to buy specific bags.,[]
"Plus it's true, there really is no odor.",[]
"Of course it smells when you open it up to change the bag, but a quick shot of Oust does the trick.",[]
"The Diaper Champ holds roughly 40 to 50 size 1 and size 2 diapers, so for parents of singletons you'll probably only have to change the bag once a week.",[]
"So, why didn't I give the Diaper Champ 5 stars?",[]
"Two reasons... First of all, since there's no assembly required, there are no directions.",[]
I had to come online to read the product reviews to figure out how to open it to put a bag in.,[]
(There's a blue bar on the front of the Diaper Champ... put some muscle in to it and pull up to lift the lid up).,[]
"Second, despite warnings in other reviews, I've broken several fingernails opening it up.",[]
"But this truly is a great product, and really, who needs long nails when you're taking care of babies?",[]
I received the diaper champ as a baby shower gift.,[]
"Although this wasn't the one on my register, I decided to try it.",[]
"My son is 8 months old, and I have been using it since he was born.",[]
I absolutely love it!,[]
It is really easy to use.,[]
It is conveniently placed next to the changing table.,[]
"After I finish changing a dirty diaper, all I have to do is reach over and drop it in the diaper pail and turn the handle.",[]
The diaper falls in easily without a problem.,[]
The diaper hesitates to fall only when the bag is starting to get full.,[]
"At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.",[]
"If you change the bag as soon as the problem starts with the diaper dropping down, the bag will not be full.",[]
"On the other hand, when I do bounce the pail to get more diapers in, when I do change the trash bag, it is really heavy to lift but not impossible.",[]
"With all of that being said,  I only have to change the trash bag 1-2 times per week.",[]
It also conceals the odor well.,[]
Anything that houses soiled material will begin to smell after sitting up so long before changing it.,[]
I have only had a problem with the odor when I have gone too long without changing the bag simply because I was being lazy.,[]
"Changing the bag 1-2 times per week is not much, considering I change my kitchen trash almost daily.",[]
"Also, I disinfect the pail 1-2 times per month.",[]
Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.,[]
"Even though we see them as our precious little ones,  their poop stinks just like ours.The advantages are: easy to use, convenient, accepts any household trash bag, conceals odorThe only small problem is that you do have to be careful when opening the top.",[]
It can catch your fingers.,[]
"But after having it so long, I have mastered that part.",[]
I can open it without hurting my fingers.,[]
"As with anything, once you get use to something you know how to handle it.",[]
So this is why I consider this a small problem.,[]
"As for you people with nails,  I don't have any, but I am sure you can figure out somethiing so that your nails don't get broken.",[]
I've been using the Diaper Champ for our eight week old's cloth diapers since we brought her home from the hospital.,[]
It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!,[]
"Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.",[]
We're planning on buying a second one for use downstairs.,[]
"I love this...the fact that I can use regular garbage bags, it's bigger than the Diaper Genie so it holds more, and it DOES NOT stink up her room!",[]
I do seem to have to push that thing down in the middle after I flip it but it's no big deal.,[]
This product is wonderful!,[]
"It is very easy to use, refill, and move around.",[]
My only complaint is that it could be a little bigger to hold a bit more.,[]
It keeps the smell OUT completely!,[]
The fact that I can use a regular trash bag is a definite plus to a mommy with a small budget!I highly recommend this product!,[]
I bought this after reading everyone's reviews and I also didn't want to have to purchase special bags.,[]
It truly does work.,[]
I hardly ever smell an odor in my daughter's room and we put some really stinky diapers in there.,[]
You do have to change the bag at least once a week or more often depending on how many diapers you put into it.,[]
The Kirkland Kitchen bags from Cosco work great and are cost effective.,[]
The Diaper Champ worked great for about the first eight months.,[]
"After that, it started to loose it's ability to contain the stink.",[]
We have resorted to placing the Diaper Champ on the back patio.,[]
I hope it doesn't attract any wildlife!,[]
"My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.",[]
"We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.",[]
We liked it because:1.,[]
It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.2.,[]
You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.3.,[]
"It never smelled - at all.Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.",[]
I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.,[]
"I just know it really worked for us.The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.)",[]
I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.,[]
"We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.",[]
I received this as a baby shower gift.,[]
It is great.,[]
You can use regulaar trash bags with it and not spend tuns of money buying refils.,[]
Some people complain about the smell but comes with every diaper disposal unit.,[]
Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.,[]
If you put you poo in the trash in would make your trash can stink too.,[]
My baby is now 8 months and the can has been helpful.,[]
"I think it's great to make sure the really smelly ones are sealed, especially if I can't run to dump the trash outside.",[]
"I do usually bag the really bad ones, so I don't dirty the the entry.",[]
It's also great now that the baby is crawling.,[]
"She can easily knock over a trash can, but the Diaper Champ is much heavier and she hasn't been able to get into it.",[]
"I doubt she will be able to get into it even when she is older.The bags are easily replaceable and affordable, far more than other options.",[]
"My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.",[]
"My friends liked my choice.You do have to empty the Diaper Champ can and clean it, but since it holds some pretty toxic trash, I would recommend that with any disposal system.",[]
I'm extremely satisfied.,[]
I registered for this pail after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon for it.,[]
"It is very easy to use, but my baby's room stinks from this daiper pail.",[]
I sometimes wash it but that doesn't help either.,[]
I was quite pleased with this for the first 6 months.,[]
"Now as my son's diet is changing, the odor of his bowl movements can no longer be contained.",[]
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.,[]
There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).,[]
The problem is if the diaper bag gets too full it makes it really hard to pull out the diapers.Pros:- cheaper than alternatives- worked great the first 6 months- was able to use normal garbage bagsCons:- smells after 6 months- bad tapered design makes it hard to remove diapers,[]
Have had no problems with this!,[]
We use regular scented trash bags & empty out twice a week.,[]
"No issues with smells, but we keep it in the bathroom and use scented trash bags so that may help.",[]
We used the diaper genie with our first baby & this one is considerably much better.,[]
Good price too!,[]
"Over the past several years, I have babysat for many different families.",[]
"In every home where there was a child in diapers, there was a Diaper Genie.",[]
"Recently, I had my first child, and I decided to try the Diaper Champ instead.",[]
I am so glad that I did.,[]
"I find it much simpler to use than the genie, and I have had no problems with odors.",[]
(I don't think this should be an issue if the bag is replaced every few days.),[]
It is also nice being able to use any garbage bag instead of having to purchase special bags.,[]
I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!,[]
I love the Diaper Champ and I plan to get another one!,[]
I have one in the baby's room and I'd like another one for downstairs next to her pack 'n play (since it has a changing table on it).,[]
"I feel like it keeps odors in as long as you do what other people suggested such as every time you take out a bag, spray and air out for a couple minutes and then replace with a new bag.",[]
"Also, I always make sure that I roll up each diaper securely before putting it in the diaper champ.",[]
We only have to empty ours about every 2 weeks right now (our baby is 11 weeks old) because I change her downstairs half of the time.I really like the fact that you can use your own trash bags.,[]
What a cost saver.,[]
"No special bags, no twisting (like the diaper genie), no tying special knots in the bags, no buying refills... as you can see I don't like the genie one bit.",[]
As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.,[]
Think of someone who comes to watch your baby - the diaper champ is so easy and they'll almost never have to change the bag for you.,[]
That diaper genie was always full when I was babysitting.,[]
"Ugh!The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars, was because you can easily break your nails trying to open it up to replace the bag (the first time I did, despite the warnings!).",[]
And the lid doesn't stay open for you to air it out unless you prop it open... but that's only for a few mintues anyways.,[]
I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.,[]
"Speaking of hands, you only need one hand to throw away that messy diaper too!I highly recommend the diaper champ - in fact, I'm buying another one today!",[]
"I love the convenience of not having to worry about special bags, that's why I rated this so high.",[]
"However, when I first started using this diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter's diapers was getting stuck on something inside the lid.",[]
"Needless to say, getting the diapers unstuck was disgusting.",[]
"Once I yanked out the fabric that the diapers were getting stuck on, I really liked the diaper pail.",[]
"The dirty diapers still stink, so I put each dirty diaper in its own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbage so that they go out every night.",[]
Now my house never stinks like a dirty diaper.,[]
I got the Diaper Champ because I had friends who had the Diaper Genie and it always seemed so difficult to use.,[]
I would go to change my daughters diaper at their house and wouldn't be able to figure out how to put the diaper in it.,[]
"I liked the Diaper Champ because you could use regular trash bags instead of refills, which saves a lot of money.",[]
"But, my daughter's room always stinks horribly.",[]
"I'm also a nursery coordinator at my church, and because the Champ doesn't close on top, the kids would stick their hands in it and we would have to shoo them away and wash their hands.",[]
I just bought the new Diaper Genie II because I am hoping that it will eliminate the smell.,[]
"If you don't mind the stench get the Champ, but I almost think it's worth the few extra bucks to buy refills for the Genie and not have a room that smells like poop.",[]
"You know in the cartoons when they would put a clothspin to their noses, well, that is how we were with our champ.",[]
"When I had mine, I had two kiddos in diapers, a new born and a 1 year old...with in 6 months it got NASTY!",[]
IT got to where we had to leave it out side.,[]
WE tried everything to get that smell out.,[]
"We soaked it in bleach water for a week, smelled like bleach and portapotty, then we did baking soada, nope, just made the portapotty smell worse, we tried airing it out...made it worse...THe plastic holds in the smell so so so bad.",[]
So we ended up just throwing it away!,[]
After the champ we just started to throw away the diapers in the regular garbage and took it out daily...no smells that way.Also if you are planning on using this for cloth diapering (several of my friends are) when you get to a med.,[]
"diaper, they won't fit in the hole.",[]
I cloth diapered for a while.,[]
I love the Diaper Champ.,[]
"I like that you can use regular medium sized garbage bags, how easy the handle flips over to put the dirty diaper in the bag and that it doesn't leave the room smelly when you dispose of the diaper.",[]
"When it starts to get a little hard to flip, I shake the Diaper Champ to settle the diapers and make more room in the bag for another days worth of diapers.",[]
It's also easy to wipe down.,[]
I definitely recommend using this product.,[]
The Diaper Champ is wonderful!,[]
My son is now 7 months old an I still have no smell.,[]
I change the bag at least one time a week if not more.,[]
"I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.",[]
"The handle does tend to get stuck when the pail is full, but it is just a sign that I need to take it out.",[]
Overall it is probably the best baby item I have purchased!,[]
We love this diaper pail.,[]
"I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.",[]
"The Diaper champ is easy to use single-handed, and is tall enough so you don't have to bend over much to use it.",[]
"We found it contains even the stinkiest diapers well, and can fit quite a few in there.",[]
"By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.",[]
"The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.",[]
"It doesn't seem to bother the baby, but I don't want to take any chances!",[]
The other pail we use is very inferior.,[]
"It takes 2 hands to operate, is very short and doesn't contain the smell well.",[]
We would buy the diaper champ for any of our friends having babies.,[]
This diaper pail is wonderful at first.,[]
You can use regular kitchen garbage bags in it so you don't have to buy the expensive refills like with the Diaper Genie.,[]
"Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great.",[]
"However, once your baby starts eating solid foods, you may need to invest in something like a Diaper Genie.",[]
My daughter started eating solids about 3 months ago and we're still using the Diaper Champ without any problems but we have an air filter RIGHT next to it.,[]
"When we first started using the Diaper Champ, we sometimes noticed an odor when it was starting to get full (but really we only noticed it smelling on rare occasions).",[]
"Now, the only time I notice an odor is when the air filter needs to be replaced.The Diaper Champ is tall - like a kitchen garbage can - but not any bigger around than a Diaper Genie.",[]
One thing I had a hard time with at first was getting the thing open to change the bag.,[]
"But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.",[]
"All in all, I would recommend the Diaper Champ to any new parents, mostly for the cost savings where bags are concerned.",[]
I got one of these and a diaper genie for gifts.,[]
I decided to try them both out and see which I liked better.,[]
The diaper champ defintly won!,[]
"I love not having to buy refills, my regular trash bags work just fine.",[]
It completly hides odors and is very easy to clean and use.,[]
It also holds more then the genie.,[]
"I got this diaper pail as a shower gift, cause thats what I wanted.",[]
"It works good, for holding a lot of diapers.",[]
But after some time it starts to smell.,[]
"I have used sprays, deoderizers, air freshners, etc., it takes care of the smell for a couple hours, then it comes back.",[]
"I have taken it outside and washed it out and then let it air dry, but that still didn't work.",[]
"I still use it, and just put up with the smell.",[]
So I don't know if I would recommend it or not.,[]
It's amazing how well this diaper pail keeps in the odor.,[]
My husband and I didn't realize it until we opened it up to take out the bag.,[]
Love this product..a must!,[]
!,[]
I don't know what these people are talking about when they say it smells.,[]
I never had a problem.,[]
"Whenever I change the garbage bag, I spray some lysol or febreze and that's it.I can't imagine myself spending money to buy refills for a diaper pail...",[]
The greatest thing about this is you can use your own trash bags that you usually buy in bulk anyway.,[]
That alone saves you a ton of $.,[]
(beleive me you will go through a lot of the bags!),[]
so it does make a HUGE difference if you have to buy the bags for the diaper genie.,[]
It also controls the smell.,[]
go for the champ,[]
"I like it just enough, I guess.",[]
"Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.",[]
But overall it works as fine as any wastebasket with a cover should.,[]
I don't know what we would have done with out it.,[]
This is a super product and saves tons of money.,[]
(no special bags)!,[]
the cost written on amazon is 149.99 which is way over priced.,[]
Hopefully just an error that will be corrected.,[]
This should run you around 35$.,[]
I've noticed several items overpriced on amazon so make sure you check prices on other sites/stores first before over paying!,[]
This is one great diaper pail.,[]
I cannot smell any diapers in my son's room.,[]
It's easy to use.,[]
Cheap to keep in trash bags.,[]
And holds a week's worth of diapers.,[]
Trash day we just empty it and out to the trash it goes.,[]
Yeah for the Diaper Champ!!,[]
!,[]
This is a great for dirty Diapers.,[]
I have had no problem with smells.,[]
And it is easy to empty out.,[]
I love It!!,[]
!,[]
"Cost IS a FactorWe try and watch are money (like most folks) and in comparing the Diaper Champ to the Diaper Genie it was a hands down winner!We looked at the Diaper Genie, even had a recommendation from another couple for it while shopping but, still there was this hesitation....proprietary bags.My wife and I discussed it briefly.",[]
I offered that the D.G.,[]
"locked us into some expensive bags, where the Diaper Champ didn't.",[]
"However, I DID agree that if the Champ was ever ""retired"" for poor odor control we'd rub that magic lamp and get a Diaper Genie!What We Discovered Outside the Ring (Home)Once I got the Champ out of the box just pop the main basket into the base, put in a bag and you're ready for Round One!I discovered that the Champ was a little tough to open.","[('champ', 0.1543424237186629)]"
There is a tab on one side of the unit that must be lifted to access the bag.,[]
My wife nearly broke a fingernail trying to open it.,[]
(Maybe she just wanted me to take the full bags out?),[]
;-)Daily Operation is a BreezeOnce you've folded the diaper up drop it in the shoot and move the handle over.,[]
This forces the weighted plunger to push the diaper in the bag.,[]
Super easy...no hand cranking!The seal has dislodged a bit but this has had no negative impact on blocking the odors.RecommendedYes,[]
I love the Diaper Champ!,[]
"My room is also my son's room, so it was important to have a diaper disposal system that kept nasty smells locked away.",[]
"I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.",[]
"With the Diaper Champ, I simply roll up the diaper as small as possible, drop it in the hole, and flip the lever.",[]
I know when it's time to change the bag when it starts getting difficult to flip the lever.,[]
Couldn't be simpler!,[]
we had this thing for 6 months - during the winter it was fine.,[]
"however, once we started using the ac, the house started to stink.",[]
"it is not near the cold air return, but it somehow sucks the stink and blows it around the house.",[]
"even with changing the bag every day, sprays, washing it, still there.",[]
"dont understand it, but it stinks.",[]
"i even changed the furnace filter and sprayed febreeze  on it, still stinks.",[]
"Like anything that comes in contact with ""baby toxic waste"", you've got to clean it to use it properly.",[]
I keep a roll of garbage bags in the bottom of it and a can of Lysol next to it.,[]
I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.,[]
"If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.",[]
"If you wrap up the diaper with the tape, it keeps the smell out just fine.",[]
"Also, because you can use any bags with the Champ, we used some cheap eucalyptus smelling bags and it's a lot cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags!",[]
I recieved this as a baby shower gift.,[]
I absolutely love it.,[]
I bought it for a friend who had a baby shortly after me.,[]
This takes any trash bag you have around the house.,[]
"It is easy to put the trash bag in, put the diapers in, and take the trash bag out when it is full.",[]
There is no smell.,[]
I don't know how the other companies stay in business when this diaper pail is available.,[]
It is wonderful.,[]
It is  a MUST HAVE!,[]
"After reading the glowing reviews here and receiving a positive one from a friend, we decided to replace a broken Diaper Genie (lid broke off) with the Champ.",[]
What a disappointment!,[]
Here are the big two complaints:1.,[]
It's unsanitary.,[]
Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess.,[]
Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!,[]
And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.,[]
The smell.,[]
"It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!",[]
"Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.",[]
"We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.",[]
"Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.",[]
"Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.",[]
And it's certainly easy to use.,[]
"But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.",[]
"It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).",[]
"And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model, so we'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time.",[]
We purchased the Diaper Champ because you can use standard garbage bags which are extremely easy to change.,[]
The bags are secured nicely inside so they don't shift while the mechanism pushes the diapers into them.,[]
We have had no odor problems from the pail (we use the Glad Odor Guard bags).,[]
This pail has been everything we expected it to be.,[]
Its easy to clean and maintain.,[]
I recommend to anyone who wants a no nonsense pail.,[]
Anybody need two Diaper Genies?,[]
"You can have mine for free.Seriously, the Diaper Champ much easier to use and supplies are less costly.",[]
"I have purchased three Diaper Champs, one for upstairs, one for downstairs, and one for the grandparents home.",[]
"Everything about the Champ is easy, it takes 5 seconds to change the plain plastic garbage bag.",[]
"It takes 1 second to dispose of a dirty diper, just drop it in the chute and flick the handle over.",[]
"Believe me, this makes a big difference at 2:00am.",[]
And you can do it one handed.By contrast the Diaper Genie has issues.,[]
"When the Genie is full, you must press this button on top to cut the plastic.",[]
"My cut button half tears the bag, leaving me to rip the rest off.",[]
Then you must knot the top and remove the sausaged diapers through the bottom.,[]
"Next, you must pull out more plastic and knot to prepare again.",[]
"As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.",[]
"If you don't master the trick, your first 4-5 diapers are in one big group.",[]
"Also, the Genie is very hard to use one handed.",[]
We bought this when our 6 year old Diaper Genie broke.,[]
We had a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn still in diapers.,[]
"With the older child's diapers, the smell was pretty bad.",[]
"It was nice to use kitchen bags instead of buying the more expensive Diaper Genie bags, but once the child gets old enough, it just doesn't cut it because  of the smell.",[]
"We bought a new Diaper Genie, and they have made some great design improvements in the past 6 years!",[]
"The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.",[]
"If you have an infant, the Diaper Champ will probably work for you, but it won't last like the Diaper Genie.",[]
"As my baby is now 11 months, I have found that I have to change it after a few dirty diapers, because as you put a new one in the smell comes out.",[]
I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.,[]
"Let me preface with saying, you should change ANY diaper holder just like you would your own trash can.",[]
"I have never had a problem, if I changed regularly and cleaned it out.",[]
Do I leave it for an entire week?,[]
"Of course not, I change it about about every other day.",[]
"Think about it, a younger child goes through at least 10-12 diapers a day, quite a few of those are poopy.",[]
"Hello, it is not rocket science.",[]
I did only give it 4 stars because at first opening the lid was a little hard.,[]
"Now, I pop it open with no problem.",[]
The Diaper Champ is top thing on the Baby Registry that I insisted we get.,[]
(I know there's no way I was gonna shove a handfull of poopy diaper blindly into that other contraption!,[]
)The Champ has all the things that a good diaper pail should...,[]
"The lid clamps down tight, it holds alot, it uses normal kitchen trash bags, the stink stays inside, it's easy to use with one hand, and you don't have to shove your hand down inside it.Don't even think about getting the genie.",[]
WHY WE LIKE IT:-- very large capacity.,[]
Our baby goes throught at least 12 diapers a day and we still need to empty the diaper champ every three or four days.-- no smell.,[]
Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.,[]
The hole is wide and shallow enough that you can fit your hand in easily to wipe it down or direct the spray from a can of Lysol to all corners.-- uses any bag.,[]
We buy the scented bags that come in rolls of 50 ....  Much better than the diaper genie's expensive specialty bags.-- very easy to use.,[]
Just throw the dirty diaper into the top hole and flip!-- looks good.,[]
We both just like the style and look of the champ.,[]
It'll go in any nursery.WHY WE DON'T LIKE IT:-- the diapers stack one on top of the other so that you have to shake the whole unit to get the diapers to settle.,[]
I don't know if this is a consequence of the unit's design or just the way dirty diapers stack.-- the piston makes a dull thud when the top is flipped.,[]
It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.,[]
"I can do it fine, but my wife sometimes has to have me come do it for her.I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to everyone.",[]
"My brother has a diaper genie and hearing all their complaints about expenses for the bags, smell, small size, etc.",[]
make me very glad that I got the Champ.,[]
I was a diaper genie user until my son was about 1 month old.,[]
I thought that it was hard to use.,[]
We had a friend tell us about the Diaper CHAMP and told us to try it out.,[]
The name say's it all.,[]
Our son is now almost 2 years old.,[]
We just quit using the diaper champ about 3 months ago just because it was just as easy to carry them out to the trash.,[]
We have had no problems at with the diaper champ at all.,[]
It does a great job on keeping the odor in the pail.,[]
"Sure, it smells when you change the bag, but you just seal off the bag, and smell is gone.",[]
NO refills to buy or anything.,[]
ITs great.,[]
ITs a breeze to clean and empty the bag.,[]
This is way better than the diaper genie!,[]
!,[]
i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.,[]
it is very easy to use- you just put the diaper in and flip the lid.,[]
it only acts jammed when it's time to change the bag.,[]
for those who say it's not sanitary for poopy diapers- are you rolling up the diaper and closing it with the velcro pieces?,[]
my only problem with it is i can smell dirty diaper when i walk in the room.,[]
"my child is 3 mo's old and his soils have become more potent, but the pale's job is to keep the odor in.",[]
it shouldn't matter how old the child is or whther or not he's eating solids.,[]
i absolutely love this pail.,[]
i was sold once i saw that it takes both disposable and cloth.,[]
i knew i wanted to use cloth diapers but i also knew that my daughter would be what ppl consider small (5p 7oz) when she was born.,[]
As a result of her size her diaper covers were WAY too big.,[]
so we used disposable for the first month until she could grow into Newborn size.,[]
we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.,[]
it holds about 30 cloth diapers and wipes.the only bad thing is:if you put water and some sort of laundry product in for the diapers to soak (we use oxy clean) its too heavy to pick up and dump the water out.,[]
i just ring them out and then dump the water.,[]
as a result we change her in the laundry room.,[]
"also, if you dont fold the diaper up so that the corners arent sticking out then it might get caught and you have to open it to get it loose.",[]
i dont mind this....but then agagin i rinse and wash my daughters diapers by hand so im used to it.,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
"I have used the Diaper Genie and even though that is a good product, I much prefer this.",[]
"No refils to buy, and it is totally nose freindly (no smells).",[]
"It only smells when you open it to change the bag.I only gave it 4 stars though as another consumer mentioned it is very hard to open, broke many a nail trying to open.Otherwise a wonderful product, it can hold way more diapers than the genie can, so you don't need to change it as often.",[]
I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.,[]
It is taller than other diaper pails so you don't have to bend so far down to dispose of the diaper AND you can use regular kitchen garbage bags.,[]
I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.,[]
"My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!",[]
"I am very happy with it and would gladly recommend it, especially if you are the least bit tall.",[]
We love our diaper champ.,[]
"You can use your own garbage bags, it's GREAT!!",[]
We purchased 2 - one for the nursery upstairs and one for the main level next to her pack n play.,[]
Terrific item!,[]
This is a GREAT product.,[]
"My son is 7 mos old now and I still have no problem with an oder, as long as I clean it in between bag changes.",[]
You can use regular bags and I LOVE THIS ITEM!!!,[]
It's my favorite shower gift!,[]
I've been over to friends' houses and fought with their diaper genies.,[]
"I decided to go with the Diaper Champ instead, because you can use regular trash bags with it (much less expensive than the Genie refills).I had no complaints, until it got really warm in my daughter's room and then the smell appeared.",[]
I've tried Lysol and the dryer sheet at the bottom of the can and various other tricks to mask the odor emanating from the Champ without luck.,[]
Baby is breast-fed too.,[]
"I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.",[]
"Ick.I'm wondering if fighting with the Genie and buying refills is a better option for us, as we don't have air-conditioning and it will get warm in the room this summer!I will say this though, other reviewers have complained that the bag is not completely full when the Champ seems to need a change, but I find this convenient, as I don't have to drag out an extremely heavy bag.","[('convenient', 0.08916266806165124)]"
......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star.....,[]
Please don't buy this one!,[]
I love this product!,[]
"With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.",[]
"Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.",[]
No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!,[]
I registered for this diaper pail as opposed to a Diaper Genie because I didn't want to have to purchase refills.,[]
"So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.",[]
It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.,[]
I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.,[]
"I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.",[]
I keep this diaper pail in my son's closet.,[]
You would never know that there was soiled diapers in the closet.,[]
"Believe me, there is absolutely no odor at all!!",[]
!,[]
"After reading reviews of this diaper pail and the ubiquitous Diaper Genie, we decided to go for the Champ.",[]
We've been very pleased with it.,[]
"It really is odor free, no matter what's in those diapers!",[]
"I love the fact that it takes regular kitchen trash bags, and that it's quick and easy to empty.",[]
My only (minor!),[]
complaint is that the capacity of the Champ isn't as large as I'd like.,[]
"Then again, with twins, I'm putting in twice as many diapers per day as the average parent.",[]
"(With one baby, you can expect to empty the Champ about twice a week or so.)",[]
"Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the ""piston"" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.",[]
"Bottom line, this is the only diaper pail I'd buy (twice), even with twins!",[]
Do not waste your money on this product.,[]
We registered for this product because the reviews were great... and misleading.,[]
The reviews say it worked great at keeping the odor in... that is so not true.,[]
My son is almost one and we've been using this product for the whole time.,[]
I don't know how so many people can disagree on such an obvious issue.,[]
It either smells or doesn't smell.,[]
This product failed by the time my son was three months old...,[]
I have tried everything and feel it's now time to throw it away.,[]
This product works so bad that if I were to put the dirty diapers in the middle of the floor it would smell close to the same as it does now.,[]
Everyone says well poop smells... well then don't say that this thing does what it claims to do.,[]
It claims to keep the smell of dirty diapers in.,[]
If you have to change the bag everyday then why would anyone spend the money on purchasing a diaper pail at all when most people have to take the household garbage out everyday anyway.,[]
I have tried lysol everytime I changed the bag.,[]
I have tried cleaning it out with soap and hot water.,[]
I have tried stronger cleaning agents and nothing works.,[]
We have come to the conclusion that diaper pails in general are not worth the money.,[]
We are going to just put the diapers in with the household garbage that we take out about once a day anyway.,[]
It would be great if there was such a thing as a diaper pail that could do what it claims to do... and keep the smell in.,[]
"We just aren't going to keeping putting more money into it.Like other people have said it I could give this zero or negative stars I would, but the lowest the rating goes is one.",[]
Do not buy this product.,[]
"My son is a year old, and I have used the Diaper Champ from the first day home from the hospital.",[]
"It is so easy to use, and the smell from even the stinkiest of diapers (and my son makes some stinkers!)",[]
"goes into the champ and stays there.It is very easy to clean, and as long as you wipe it off if any poopy gets onto it, there is no smell whatsoever.Like I said, I've been using it for a year, and it has never left an odor in my son's room.",[]
It's a cinch to change the bags.,[]
"A friend of mine even switched from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after having dinner at our house.If you're like me, busy with no time to mess around with messes, I highly recommend this product!",[]
Keeps most of the smellies out of the nursery.,[]
If we have a very stinky diaper we take it outside to the trash instead of sitting on it in the pail for a few days.,[]
We have used it for 10 months &amp; it is still working great.,[]
We love that we can use any trash bags.,[]
The only time it doesn't turn easily is if it is full or it a sticky tab gets attached to the tumbler.,[]
Both are easy fixes.,[]
I love that it doesn't take a degree to change the bag as with other pails.,[]
This is the best investment i have made.,[]
It works great and keeps all the odors out!,[]
AND EXTREMELY easy to use... unlike the other diaper disposal systems.,[]
YOu can use any bags in it.,[]
And you are not spending lots of money getting the refills.,[]
I highly suggest/recommend this product to all parents out there!,[]
you will be happy you got this.,[]
I was attracted to this diaper pail because you did not have to buy special bags.,[]
It was great for the first 6 months before my son started eating food.,[]
"Then, everything went down hill quickly!",[]
The stench that permeated my son's room was not pleasant.,[]
"So, the DC is now in my attic (it was very large and unsightly as well) and I empty the trash can nightly.",[]
I first bought this item because I liked that you could use regular garbage bags.,[]
"I loved this product until I started my child on solids, then it was useless.",[]
It always smelled and I couldn't keep it in my babies room.,[]
"I went and bought the new improved diaper genie, and I don't smell a thing.",[]
before I finally bought a new diaper pail.,[]
I received the &quot;No smell diaper pail&quot; from Safety 1st and it failed to live up to it's name.,[]
The Diaper Champ is great as we only need to empty it about one a week (my baby is 13 months old) and there is no smell at all.,[]
This is going to be the gift I give to all my friends who have baby showers from now on.,[]
It's great!!,[]
!,[]
I thought about getting the diaper genie at first but then did some research.,[]
This is the best for your money!,[]
"Not only was it less expensive than most other diaper pails, it also works the best.",[]
The only time smell escapes from it is then you open it to take out the bag.,[]
"I really love how you don't have to buy bags for it, and that it takes perfectly good trash bags.",[]
That will save you a bundle of money alone!,[]
It works really great for us and we wouldn't use anything else.,[]
I wish it would hold more diapers but I really can't complain.,[]
Don't buy anything else!,[]
Our child is 7 months old and we have found this to be a wonderful product that is easy to use!,[]
I liked that you do not have to buy expesive refills---just use trash bags.,[]
"You just drop in the diaper and flip the handle (no complicated twisting the bag into a ""sausage"").",[]
It is easy to empty and the only time we smell anything is when you lift the handle to empty the trash bag but once you close it no smell.,[]
About every month I take it outside to air it out and that seems to do the trick (also lysol between bag changes helps).,[]
We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!,[]
I highlt recommend this product.,[]
We like our diaper champ because you don't have to buy special bags and it let's you know when it's full.,[]
"We don't have any smell in our babies room, and she poops a lot.",[]
I used this 3 years ago after hassling with the diaper genie.,[]
Putting in the diapers and changing out the bags was so much easier.,[]
I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!,[]
If you change it regularly then the odor was minimal if any.I am now buying another one for my baby due in 6 days!,[]
I have been using the Diaper Champ for a year now and I love it.,[]
I do not find it difficult to open at all and  I don't believe that my daughters room smells.,[]
"The only time I notice an odor is when we change bags, but then again it does contain dirty diapers that have been sitting there for a few days.",[]
I don't believe anything is that perfect.,[]
I think that the diaper champ is easy to use with just one hand as you just have to flip the lever back and fourth and the diaper drops into the pail.,[]
This diaper pail also uses regular trash bags and that was a big selling point for me.,[]
I have had no issues with this since we bought it and I would reccommend this to everyone.,[]
This product is great!,[]
It definitely keeps the odor out and the fact that you can use a regular trash bag is a definite plus.,[]
This was one of the best shower gifts I received.,[]
I liked the concept of the Diaper Champ better than the Diaper Genie.,[]
It's easy to use and it uses regular trash bags.,[]
"After the first year of use though, the thing started smelling worse and worse.",[]
"We empty it regularly, use lysol on it after every bag change, and we've even taken it outside and hosed it down and cleaned it out, and it still smells.",[]
"Overall, we were satisfied with the product and feel it is worth the money.",[]
"If you expect to use it for several years or several children, think again.",[]
Extremely easy to useUses regular trash bags and has size sufficient for a week of diapersDoesn't smell.,[]
"No odours until, lid is opened to change the trash bagsDid I say extremely convenient to use??",[]
?Definitely a recommended buy.,[]
You won't regret it!!,[]
!,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point.,[]
"If you want to, you can buy a heavy ply trash bag that now has odor protection and it's still cheaper than re-fills.The trash bags are easy to put in and take out, yet they securely stay in place.",[]
"While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.",[]
"My husband and I, or any guest for that matter, have not noticed any smells from it.I also love how easy it is to throw the diaper in it and turn the handle... no twisting of any sort needed.",[]
This diaper pail is by far the best value around!,[]
The Diaper Champ did not come with instructions on how to install the garbage bag.,[]
"I believe I initially installed it incorrectly, which is why we had such a stinky poopy-smelling room for a while (as did my best friend who had made the same mistake with hers too).",[]
Then we figured out that garbage bag needs to be threaded through the blue center hole and pulled through.,[]
That corrected the stinkiness for the most part.,[]
"However, occasionally, stinky poopy smells its way through.",[]
I have put baking soda and sprayed Lysol in the can to help with smell.,[]
Bottom line - the ad that it is &quot;odorless&quot; is not 100% true.,[]
"But for the most part, the Diaper Champ is adequate.",[]
"This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in.",[]
"It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.",[]
"It is also very user friendly in that you only need one hand, just drop in the diaper flip the handle over and you're done.",[]
We bought this in place of the genie b/c I saw how much trouble my sister in law was having with it.,[]
"As a matter of fact, she quit using the genie all together.",[]
I have advised all of my friends of this product.,[]
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.,[]
It is much easier for me to just buy some bags at the local grocery store.I recommend this product & will use it for my second son.,[]
I paid $39.99 for this on Amazon and could have bought it in the store for $29.99.,[]
WAY too overpriced!,[]
I wish I had researched a little more.,[]
"We've had the diaper champ for over a year now, and it's made diaper changes as good as they can be.",[]
"I love using whatever bags I want, and unless you come face to face with the champ you can't smell the dirty diapers.",[]
One of the best things we bought to prepare for baby over a year ago.,[]
"I have never bought any other diaper pail, so I am not sure how it stacks up, but the Diaper Champ has proven to be a good product!",[]
I use odor-reducing trash bags & the smell is very minimal.,[]
One little downfall is that it seems to fill up fast (by 3 days!,[]
)which makes it hard to turn the cover.,[]
It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.,[]
"Overall, I am happy with this product & do recommend it.",[]
This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!!!!,[]
The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags...ANY Garbage bags will fit.,[]
The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend...This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers....FANTASTIC!,[]
Daiper Champ is a true champion.,[]
Earlier i was planning to buy Diaper Genie as i had liked its innovative style.,[]
"However, all my friends were sick and tired of its refill system.",[]
"Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.",[]
"It also need some assembly while as CHAMP is so easy to use and can take any size diaper, any trash bag and even a kid can handle it with ease.",[]
We've used this Diaper Champ for the past 8 months and it's worked great.,[]
No problems or odors at all.,[]
"The best part is you use regular kitchen trash bags, no expensive specialty bags to buy.",[]
This is the best diaper pail.,[]
"I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.",[]
I highly recommend this product to everyone!,[]
"As we were getting ready to have our first child, the cost to get everything we would need was huge!",[]
"After reseaching and reading reviews and factoring the cost of replacement bags for other diaper pails, we opted for the Diaper Champ!",[]
It works like a champ!,[]
We buy the bags in boxes of 20 scented bags at the Dollar Tree and have never had an odor problem.,[]
"We empty it twice a week, wipe it down and continue on.",[]
We would recommend to everyone!,[]
A huge cost saver!,[]
I too will sing the praises of the Diaper Champ.,[]
We have been using it for 3 months and never had any odor or other problems whatsoever.,[]
We also love that it uses a regular garbage bag instead of having to purchase special bags.,[]
We have enough things we have to keep up with without having to go somewhere other than the grocery store to purchase bags for it.,[]
We have been using this diaper pail since our little girl was born in early February.,[]
It has been very effective at keeping out smells and is handy for collecting the little stinky packages she produces.,[]
It has also been very cost effective to use regular trash bags.,[]
We use the Odor Shield trash bags and they have been a perfect compliment to the Diaper Champ (they are still pretty inexpensive and are always on sale somewhere).,[]
There is absolutely no odor that we can detect.,[]
I would suggets this product to anyone!,[]
"Because you don't have to buy any refills, thank goodness, and I have a baby trend travel system that is truely awesome, I thought I'd give it a go.I couldn't be happier...no smells, easy to use and very economical for our tight budget, this pail stands up to it's name...a true champ!",[]
"The diaper champ is awesome, I have never once had a problem with odor in my sons nursery.",[]
"The only problem I do have occasionally is the tabs of a diaper getting stuck in the sliding mechanism, but a little jiggling usually fixes that easy enough.",[]
"I love the fact that it takes regular tall kitchen trash bags, it makes it so much easier to use.",[]
So far so great!,[]
I recently had twin girls and worried that it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demand.,[]
On the contrary;it has contained stinky diaper smells and is really easy to empty.,[]
No refills is a big PLUS since we empty it every other day.,[]
I recently bought a Diaper Champ but will have to return it because the drum doesn't turn.,[]
The blue rubber seal snags every time on the white plastic and makes you really have to use a lot of force to turn the drum over to dispose of the diaper.,[]
"I'm sure not every model is defective like ours is, but it is discouraging and I'm not sure I'll get another Champ to replace this one.",[]
This product is great!,[]
It is so much better than the Diaper Genie.,[]
"I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.",[]
"It is great because you can use any type of trash bag, which is alot better than going out and remembering to buy refills with everything else you have to get.",[]
"My 4 year old daughter likes to throw the diapers away for me, because it is so easy for her to do, just turn the handle.",[]
This is a great baby shower gift!,[]
"I would not recommend this diaper pail; I regret believing its claim of being ""odorless.""",[]
"I expect there to be SOME odor, but this stinks all the time.",[]
"We change it frequently, and yes, I understand that my toddler's poop is going to stink more than an infant's, etc.",[]
etc.,[]
(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.,[]
"In addition, it frequently sticks when you try to swing the handle to drop the diaper into the pail - and the pail is not full when this happens.",[]
Based on all the other reviews I'm thinking maybe I got stuck with a lemon.We used the Diaper Dekor first and that worked really well for odor control but it held less diapers and it wasn't very sturdy.,[]
(The Diaper Champ and Genie are both more solid in their construction.),[]
"Even with that though, I'm thinking about purchasing another one since we have about another year or so in diapers and I can't stand the smell with the Diaper ""Champ"" anymore.",[]
The Diaper Dekor's bags and design both work to control the odor.,[]
The refill bags last a long time so I don't care that they're proprietary.,[]
Definitely the best bet in my book.,[]
Hope this helps a potential buyer.,[]
My dogs are litter-trained.,[]
"(Yes, for real.)",[]
"Disposing of solids was a challenge, mostly because I value my toilet plumbing and I'm not confident that the litter wouldn't jam up things.I had a diaper genie.",[]
"Call me uncoordinated, but I never got the hang of it.",[]
And the refills were outrageous to replace (once a month).,[]
"I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.",[]
"I have had fewer problems with smells, and the size/heigth of the diaper genie discourages the attacks, not to mention is easier on my back.I'd strongly recommend over the Diaper Genie.",[]
I bought the diaper champ because of the convenience of using regular garbage bags with it.,[]
It was great when my son was little and only doing breastmilk poop.,[]
"But, once we started on solid foods and things got stinkier, so did the diaper champ.",[]
The whole bedroom stinks if you put a poopy diaper in the diaper champ.,[]
"We still use it, but only for wet diapers.",[]
"However, it is still better than the diaper genie which is completely useless!",[]
The Diaper Champ is the best diaper pail I've ever used!,[]
I discovered it while changing my son in a Babies R Us restroom.,[]
They had one in there next to the changing table and I had to have it!,[]
You just drop the dirty diaper into the tube and flip the handle.,[]
It couldn't be any easier and there is no mess because the tube is wide.,[]
"My 6 year old loves to flip the lid and watch the dirty diaper ""disappear"".",[]
"My baby is now 8 months old and has some seriously stinky diapers, but there is absolutely no odor in his room.",[]
I think the key is that I use the GLAD deodorized trashbags.,[]
I used the Diaper Genie for my first child and there is just no comparison.,[]
One of my friends is having a baby in August and I plan on buying her a Diaper Champ and box of those GLAD deodorant trashbags.,[]
"I know she'll love it, too.",[]
We have now been using the Diaper Champ for 6 1/2 mths and absolutely love it.,[]
We have even reached the stage where our daughter is eating cereal and vegetables (you know what that does to diapers) and it still contains the smell.,[]
We keep it in her room and never smell anything.,[]
"We do take it out of her room to change, due to other suggestions on this website and it does smell pretty bad when you open it up, since the diapers are then exposed.",[]
"We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.",[]
We have had absolutely no problems with this diaper pail and would highly recommend it to anyone!,[]
"I love the diaper champ, it truely lives up to its name!",[]
"But one thing that I must say, when unlocking the champ to change the bag watch the nails ladies!",[]
Mine usually chip when I caught them on the catch!,[]
Just be careful and yes take it slow!,[]
!,[]
I LOVE this diaper pail!,[]
Just buy regular kitchen trash bags!,[]
"I haven't found a pail yet that's completely odorless, but this one is the best!",[]
And my daughter can't get into it and pull the diapers out!,[]
This system is great.,[]
I had a diaper genie and hated it.,[]
Having to buy special refills was costly and then at times when I would do the twisting it would not seal but instead cut the bag and I would have to start the roll over.,[]
This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.,[]
As for odor complaints I do not have any and if it is a problem put a stick up in the bottom.,[]
Great product.,[]
I have to say I'm very disappointed in the Diaper Champ.,[]
"I agree it's easy to use, but the first dirty diaper and the whole room stinks.",[]
Isn't one of the big reasons you have it is to keep the room smelling fairly good?,[]
"We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!",[]
"This is our first baby so I have not tried any other product yet, but I would NOT recommend this one!",[]
The Diaper Champ is excellent.,[]
"I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby's closet.",[]
No special bags are needed ... what a savings!,[]
Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!,[]
Great value for an excellent product.,[]
six months in -- Well designed.,[]
Have had no smell problems.,[]
Ability to use regular trash bags is huge bonus.,[]
Would buy this item again without hesitation.Update -- Nine months in and have to say that this is not doing a great job of keeping smells in -- the champ has been ko'd.,[]
Worked really well though for the first eight months or so.,[]
Based on those eight months of use I would still recommend as it is easy to use and the ability to use normal trash bags is nice.,[]
"Good product, but be mindful of its limitations.",[]
"When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ.",[]
I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills.,[]
"While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired.",[]
"My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience.",[]
"Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.",[]
Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.,[]
Perhaps I'm not doing something right!,[]
but how hard can it be to drop a diaper into a pail.,[]
"This pail is convenient, in that it offers a quick fix to dispose of waste, but it leaves my baby's room smelly!",[]
"My husband and I have cleaned and spray the pail with Lysol, and it still leaves the whole house smelly.",[]
"We have however, remedied this by wrapping the poopie diapers in the small plastic bags we get from the grocer, and then dispose of them in the pail.",[]
This is the only relief we get from the smell.,[]
I love this diaper pail.,[]
We got it for our youngest son (who is 2 now) and are now using it with our baby girl(5 months old).its really easy to use and I love the fact that it uses regular trash bags.,[]
"the only thing that made me only give it 4 stars, is that when you change the bag, the pail tends to tip over and the lid close.",[]
You definitly have to put the baby down...,[]
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!,[]
"You use any type of bag you want, and I love this idea.",[]
The refills for all the others are so spendy and they don't hold that many diapers.,[]
I'd rather buy cheap 13 gallon garbage bags from wal-mart or use one of the gazillion plastic grocery bags we already have in a cupboard at home.,[]
It also keeps the smell away perfectly fine-until you open it of course to take the bag out to the garbage can!,[]
It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well.,[]
I think it's great and I highly recommend it to every family that loves to save money.,[]
"We bought this thinking we were getting a great deal, an easy to use odorless pail that uses regular trash bags.",[]
WRONG!,[]
Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.,[]
It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.,[]
Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage.,[]
We never felt any kind of smell.,[]
"We love it, especially the fact that it works so simple, and you don't have to buy refills.Go for it!",[]
"Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers.",[]
"We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable.",[]
"It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers.",[]
"It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun.",[]
She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail.,[]
I'm not sure about this one.,[]
"In concept, it's a fabulous idea.",[]
I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.,[]
I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.,[]
"The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.",[]
"In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.",[]
My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.,[]
"If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.",[]
I have a 2 year old.,[]
We started out with the diaper genie.,[]
Worked fine but we went through the refills like mad.,[]
We got the cheaper diaper pail and used it for about 2 months and the odor from it was atrocious.,[]
"Finally, finally we bought the diaper champ.",[]
It has been wonderful.,[]
"Every now and then we detect the really 'foul' diaper, but we immediately change the bag and all is good again.",[]
"This is a must have and much more economical, even for those with Toddlers.",[]
My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it.,[]
"The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.",[]
It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle won't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it.,[]
"Plus, I think it is unsanitary.",[]
"The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag.",[]
"Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean.",[]
"Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail.",[]
"(It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either!)",[]
"I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week.",[]
"I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.",[]
I do not recommend this product.,[]
I liked this product so much I bought a second one!Now I don't have to run upstairs to the nursery to dispose of diapers.,[]
I even have the Diaper Champ in my Family Room by the Pack n Play and never smell anything but my dog-LOL!!,[]
!Great Product-Buy it!,[]
"We have purchased this diaper pail four years ago [I was so disgusted with Diaper Genie we had at the time (not just wasting the money on the refills, but also the smell and having to push & twist was more than I wanted to deal with)].Diaper Champ was so much easier to operate!",[]
"When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly.",[]
"[We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week].",[]
"We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!",[]
"It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone.",[]
"While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment.",[]
"It does not contain odors very well, not any better than a standard rubbermaid trash can that goes for about $15 cheaper.",[]
"The diapers would frequently jam when you when you went to rock the handle and dispose of the diaper, smearing poop along the way.",[]
We replaced it with the Safety 1st diaper pail which is much easier to use and holds back the odor relatively well.,[]
I've used all types of diaper disposal systems and I've found this one to be the easiest.,[]
"I love that you can use any bags with it, and it doesn't take 2 hands to throw away a diaper.",[]
"My 6 year old likes it so much, she insists on trashing the diapers for me!",[]
"After four months of use, I haven't had any problems with it.",[]
This product is wonderful and practical!,[]
You put the dirty diaper in and it disappears.,[]
It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.,[]
I do recommend lysol and clorox wipes cleaning every once in a while.,[]
The handle makes it easy to carry out to the garage to change the bag.,[]
"We, too considered several brands, and decided on the Champ.",[]
"It has been great to use...very simple, great odor control, no special bags to buy (we went to Sam's Club and bought an extra large box of large kitchen garbage bags to use in it) and it's easy to change.Overall, when I've used the Diaper Genie in the past it definitely doesn't measure up to the higher standards set by the Diaper Champ.",[]
Get this one!,[]
I found it difficult to choose a diaper pail for my son because with my daughter I did not like the one I had very much.,[]
I was considering not buying one at all because I would just throw any dirty diapers outside in the trash but I ended up putting this one on my registry.,[]
The #1 fact that lured me to this one is that you could use any trash bags in in...no refill bags to have to purchase!,[]
If I had one complaint it would be that it does leave out a little odor but I'm starting to think that no diaper pail is full proof against the smell of a dirty diaper!,[]
I,[]
"If you are thinking about ordering this item and don't live in California, I'd rethink.",[]
We ordered one and it arrived in a box barely taped shut -- the box was not sturdy enough to survive mailing and was pretty flimsy.,[]
There was no padding or anything in the box to protect the product during shipping.The diaper champ doesn't work.,[]
The flip mechanism appears jammed and I can't figure out how to get it fixed.,[]
"The instructions are no help, whatsoever.",[]
Customer service was closed the day I called.,[]
"I'm sure it got damaged somehow in shipping.Anyway, I've messed with this stupid diaper pail as much as I am going to.",[]
"They call it the ""easiest diaper pail to use.""",[]
I beg to differ.,[]
I registered for the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie because you could use any bags and the reviews were so good.,[]
It is excellent!,[]
There is not even the slightest smell from the pail!,[]
I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!,[]
I highly recommend the Champ.,[]
I absolutely LOVE this diaper pail.,[]
We've used it now for 2 years since my son was born and it's the easiest thing to use and does not stink up your baby room!!!,[]
I can't say enough great things about it.,[]
If you use all of my suggestions it will really do the trick !!,[]
!My suggestions:1.,[]
Empty it out TWICE a week.,[]
"We empty it on Tuesdays and Saturdays, it's full of diapers anyway.",[]
"If you leave the bag in longer, yes, it will start to smell....",[]
HELLO!!,[]
(...)!2.,[]
"Keep roll or handful of kitchen trash bags in bottom of pail all ready for you,  so all you have to do is lift out bag that's filled with diapers, and grab new bag from bottom.",[]
(My husband thought I was brilliant when he saw this :o)3.,[]
"SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.",[]
"Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.",[]
"*** TIP - if the handle ever gets tight to pull it's either too FULL so empty it, or.... you've gotten something stuck in the turn mechanism,ie.... a wipe, or glove or part of the diaper closure tab.------> Make sure and wrap everything up within the dirty diaper, closing it up tightly with the velcro tab thingys, then your problem is solved.Again, this is the BEST diaper pail!!!!!","[('problem', 0.07724687716933615)]"
All the others are a royal pain in the behind.,[]
There are no special bags you have to buy or spend countless hours trying to install them perfectly.,[]
"Just use regular ol' kitchen bags and it takes about 15 - 20 seconds to change the bag, and NO horrible stinky after odor.",[]
What's better than that!!!,[]
"!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.",[]
"Try not flushing your toilet for a week, do you think it's gonna stink?BUY THIS pail TODAY!!!",[]
!Good Luck!,[]
I received this diaper pail from a friend.,[]
With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.,[]
The Diaper Champ is much easier to use and requires less effort.,[]
I have found that both diaper pails can have a smelly issue with them if you do not empty them at least once a week.,[]
But that would also happen if we only flushed our toilets once a day too.,[]
"The best thing I like about the Diaper Champ is, its one handed use to dispose of the diapers.",[]
"The diaper genie is also supposed to be only one handed, but I always found my self having to either use two hands, one to lift the lid and the other to push the diaper in and turn the bag.",[]
"I also found the height for the Diaper Champ was much better, I didn't feel like I was going to drop the baby putting the diapers in or have to do some backbends to stand up straight while disposing of the diapers.",[]
I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.,[]
Overall I think this is a great product and recommend it to others.,[]
Just remenber you still have to change the bags and clean it just like your own bathroom.,[]
We like this diaper pail.,[]
"I've had two others with our older kids--one a diaper genie (which I personally found to be a pain) and another by fisher price that I don't know if they still  make.We used this for all diapers for the first six months, until our baby started having solid food.",[]
"As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.",[]
"(Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don't personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)",[]
My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.,[]
It's easy to change out.,[]
"I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don't expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.",[]
We still use it for the wet ones.,[]
"It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn't), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that's ridiculous on my part.",[]
"The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.",[]
"And the fact that you can't go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.",[]
"The longer they sit, the more rank they get.",[]
"Now that he's older and doesn't go through 15 diapers a day, I only change it about once a week.",[]
I chose this product primarily because of all the wonderful reviews I've read online.,[]
"Of course I was a bit sketchy despite the reviews, but proceeded to add this product to my baby shower list regardless.",[]
"After my daughter was born on 6/2/03, I was more than pleased with the way the Diaper Champ is able to contain all the odors!",[]
I've been consistently using the Diaper Champ in disposing all of my daughter's dirty diapers on a daily basis and not once have I been disappointed with the way it contains all the odors from spilling out and into the nursery.,[]
I'm also impressed with the size as well in that it seems to be a bottomless pit/black hole each time I toss a diaper away.,[]
I'd say I would only change the lining once or twice a week!,[]
