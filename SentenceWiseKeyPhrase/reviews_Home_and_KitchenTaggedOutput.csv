I am so upset.,[]
as an owner of 11 cup Cuisinart I just wanted something smaller and saw this by accident less than a month ago-28 days ago to be exact at my local Ross store.,[]
i got so excited that bought it right away.,[]
"As my other Cuisinart was a real workhorse, and because of my confidence in this brand I did not keep the original box or the receipt.I was disappointed from the get-go:it was struggling to chop half an onion into uniform pieces.",[]
the same goes to tomatoes.so Yesterday I tried to make hummus using a can of garbanzo beans and the moment I turned it on in less than a minute I smelled the funky smell and panicked and turned the unit off.,[]
"when i tried to start it again it would not start-my little machine has died on me.I called cuisinart right now and tried to explain them what happened, they said they can do nothing, without the damn receipt or the serial number.",[]
THERE IS NO DAMN SERIAL NUMBER UNDER THE UNIT AS I WAS TOLD!!!!,[]
"CUISINART, I WAS YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR YEARS AND YEARS.",[]
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU WERE BETTER 100 TIMES THAN KITCHENAID.,[]
"WELL, MAYBE I WAS DAMN WRONG.",[]
We bought it to make baby food with.,[]
It's the perfect size for that!,[]
An excellent little workhorse.,[]
"I am cooking for two, and it handles all my small needs quickly and efficiently: garlic mincing, parmesan grating, herb chopping, pesto making, and more.",[]
It speeds up my prep time considerably and takes a lot of the hassle out of using small amounts of various items.,[]
I couldn't be happier with it.,[]
Never expected it to be so difficult to find a high quality mini processor for everyday use.,[]
The Cuisinart looks good but that's it.,[]
"As Janet D. said, it purees some of the food while leaving some large chunks - in the same batch!",[]
I am returning the Cuisinart tomorrow.,[]
Can't chop anything well.,[]
"[Tried onions, tomatoes, celery, olives, nuts, and many other items.]",[]
"Tried 2, 4, and 8-oz loads.",[]
"Tried 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half ""as is"".I think it could ""mix"" 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler, blender, and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them.","[('cup', 0.17884978440149207)]"
"I already have one of these I had purchased a year ago on Amazon, and, I absolutely love it.",[]
"It does a great job chopping onions, pecans, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.",[]
"I ordered this one for my daughter, and, she loves it.",[]
I use this mini a lot more than I use my food processor.,[]
"The size works great, especially when baking!",[]
I highly recommend!,[]
I just threw this away after having it for two years.,[]
"I think I used it 5-6 times, and nearly every time, it either made the veggies into pulp or got stuck and wouldn't chop.",[]
"It's too small for most jobs, but won't work with tiny quantities of herbs, either.",[]
"The last time I tried to use it, it just stopped spinning.",[]
"i am using this since 3 months.bcoz its mini processor its eazy to use,and fast and powerful machine,only problem is the blade,bcoz its 2 in 1,same blade does chopping and grinding so removing the blade is kind of tricky,if accidently ur fingers slips there r chances of cutting fingers.v need to b very careful while removing its blade,thats the reason i am giving this processor 4 star.","[('blade', 0.16014652357787634)]"
and the otherthing is other day the cover(lid) slip out of my hand on my kichen tiles and got broke.i was heartbroken bcoz i cannot use it with out its cover untill i find it other new cover.overall it gives good service but need to be carefull while using it.,[]
This size is only really good for coffee beans or spices.,[]
I neede something more utilitarian so I purchased a larger size.,[]
"I needed a replacement for my broken ""Cuisinart DLC-1SS Mini-Prep Processor, Brushed Stainless Steel"" since we use it for the baby to mix and blend foods.",[]
"The seller had send this item fast and with no problems, for which I am very thankful.",[]
"I will definitely buy from this seller again in the future.This is a great and indespensible item for all who have babies, by the way.Thank you.",[]
"I was very disappointed when I opended the box, and found only one Mini-Prep Processor instead of ordered two.",[]
"I wrote about problem twice, but Amazon still  stays in silence.",[]
"Moreother, Mini-Prep is too small and too noisy during work.It is like a bad toy.",[]
It is really flimsy piece of junk.,[]
So I am stuck with another unusable purchase ordered online.,[]
Was a little skeptical of how this would hold up.,[]
Very impressed.,[]
It gets much more use than the larger cuisinart.,[]
I had an older model (20+ years older).,[]
"The plastic attachment for the blade broke, so I decided to get a new Mini-Prep and replace the old one.Even using it at its highest speed, this one is so grossly underpowered that it can't even make a simple mayonnaise.Too bad, because it looks really cool.",[]
This machine had a lot of power and for it's size and it's appearence isn't &quot;dinky&quot; or &quot;cheap&quot; just because it's small.,[]
The 2 different setting are helpful.,[]
Just be careful not to over grind as it is easy to do.,[]
I bought this in preperation for having gastric bypass because I didn't want something huge on my counter when I would only be pureeing maybe 3 oz of food at a time.,[]
"Well, I tested it when I took it out of the box and it turned on and worked but 3 months later when I actually went to use it...nada.",[]
Completely dead and I hadn't ever even put food into it.,[]
I no longer have the box or receipt so I don't know if I can return it.,[]
"I may just junk it after reading these reviews and buy something better, despite the size.",[]
I was sick of using a blender for all my pureering and grinding tasks.,[]
I missed the 'Sumeet Mixie' that used to be a norm in every Indian house back then :-( I had to do a lot of research to find its counterpart.,[]
"I think this is even better as is takes lesser space and is small yet sufficient for my kind of cooking (involving pureeing onions, tomatoes, making ginger garlic pastes, coconut chutneys!)",[]
"This small machine is strong enough and just perfect for making chutneys, pesto, and other pureeing tasks!",[]
Owned this for a month.,[]
Make peanut butter with it all the time.,[]
Great little unit totally.,[]
"It has a good motor, high watts, runs very well at 2 speeds.",[]
I particularly shopped around for a peanut butter maker as normal peanut butter gives me indigestion.,[]
"This does a good job, smooth or crunchy and with just peanuts and olive oil.",[]
For a single person just the best size totally.,[]
I can see some people have negative experiences.,[]
"Strange, it is well built, does what I want.",[]
I will continue to post here if things change.2 months later.,[]
"Works great, I make peanut butter all the time with it.",[]
Small quantities but it is fresh.,[]
"I loaded some images, and the recipe is:250 grams of roasted peanuts, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and away you go, slightly crunchy peanut butter.",[]
"It would do smooth but the motor labors a little when you try to make it too smooth.Yes, the blades are sharp.",[]
Someone complained about that but one just has to be careful.6 months later.,[]
Still the most wonderful little blender.,[]
Made so much peanut butter that this unit has paid for itself many times over.,[]
So much healthier and fresh than store bought nut butters.2 years later.,[]
How many kilos of peanut butter I can't say but it still works just great.,[]
A very happy camper.,[]
I will post when it finally dies but I hope it is some time later.,[]
The one con I have is that I did not realize how small this item is!SMALL!Now I am sure if I had read more on the add it said the size specs.,[]
somewhere on the listing but I did not.,[]
My girlfriend has made me wonderful food and she has a gluten allergy so cooking and processing our food is critical.This little guy is doing its job admirably.,[]
"Besides myself being a Cuisinart snob, I will say that I wouldn't use any other product in my kitchen.",[]
"This does a wonderful job on small jobs such as pestos, or making peanut butter.",[]
I purchased this for my daughter who is a senior in college.,[]
"When I gave it to her, her roommate began jumping up and down and clapping.",[]
She seemed more excited than my daughter as she said now they could do pesto!!,[]
!,[]
perfect handy little machine for whipping up quick sauces or purees i wish I would have opted or the bigger size its good for 1-2 servings but if your cooking for more people I recommend just go with the bigger size and save your self some time and money.,"[('size', 0.16045385363082926)]"
Also when processing on Hi this thing is ear piercingly loud.,[]
"nice product, but not what i thought it was.",[]
"the description lead me to believe it was a food processor, not a food chopper.",[]
i was looking for a processor with changing blades for more uses.,[]
guess this one goes out as a christmas gift.,[]
Great little food processor.,[]
"For quick use, easy to clean up and a lot of power.",[]
I purchased this from Amazon and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.,[]
This is a nice product but I wouldn't say excellent.Pros - Does regular day to chopping nicely.,[]
"Some pieces comes out uneven even after cutting it into small pieces before hand, but I can deal with that.",[]
It's really fast for small works.,[]
Most chopping take hardly 10-20 seconds.,[]
"Good for grinding as well.Cons - Even after scraping the food in between couple of times, it leaves some whole pieces at bottom.",[]
I use it for making baby food as well so I don't expect chunks in my baby food.,[]
This is the best mini food processor I have ever owned.,[]
Would recommend it without hesitation.My daughter-in-law has one and loves it.,[]
Smaller then I thought it would be but it's good I'm sure it will be great for making homemade salsa,[]
I got mine at a garage sale new for $3.,[]
I love it.,[]
"I make hummus in it a lot, and some pestos.",[]
The only problem I have had is that the prep bowl split so that I can only use it for non-runny items.,[]
I'm trying to find an inexpensive replacement bowl.,[]
"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, and was just what she wanted.",[]
"She is very particular about what she wants, and was very pleased.",[]
I'd recommend to buy this one.,[]
"This one chops very good specially garlics, onions, etc.",[]
It lasts long too.,[]
Our previous last about 6-7 years.,[]
"We own full size Cuisinart food processors, with multiple blades for over thirty years.",[]
"The mini is just right for small jobs, i.e., chopping an onion.",[]
It does these tasks quite well!,[]
This unit just stop working after 2 weeks.,[]
it will not do anything now.,[]
i tried every outlet in the house just to make sure it was not me power.,[]
I have had this little chopper for probably a year.,[]
A year far too long for what it's worth.,[]
"The idea of a mini processor sounds very appealing, and if I had done some research before I went to a store and picked out the first one I saw, I would probably be writing a better review on another product.",[]
This processor is very weak.,[]
I can't even chop up nuts without HUGE chunks that don't get down into the blade.,[]
Making a dip?,[]
Forget about it.,[]
"I get that this is a ""mini"" processor, but it should do what it was intended for, and it has not worked up to par.",[]
Go with a better model.,[]
I purchased this to make baby food and it fit the bill perfectly.,[]
No complaints.,[]
"I received my Mini-Prep about two weeks ago, and I have used it everyday 2 or 3 times a day to make homemade baby food for my daughter.",[]
It is GREAT!,[]
It is easy to clean and I love that you can switch the blade from sharp to grind mode!,[]
I do recommend looking over the user guide for which blade side and speed for optimal chopping/processing.,[]
"I had been using my full size Cuisinart to make her baby food prior to getting this, which as any one with the full size Cuisinart knows is a pain to drag out and I couldn't make just small portions for her.",[]
"So, the Mini-Prep was the perfect solution for me!",[]
I have processed just about anything and everything in this so far and it has worked beautifully!,[]
I highly recommend this for any small job in the kitchen.,[]
Another plus is you are able to buy extra bowls so if you want to use it for coffee or spice grinding you can have a bowl specifically for those uses so other foods do not absorb the flavors of coffee or spices.,[]
My wife wanted this for very simple tasks in her Thai restaurant.,[]
"She opened the box, wiped/washed the vessel clean, dumped in some garlic and fresh chilis, and hit Play.",[]
"It worked like a charm, and is still doing it a month later, heavy-duty, even though it is not specifically rated for such commercial work.",[]
"It is precisely what she wanted, and does exactly the task it says it does.",[]
"There are no drawbacks, actually, but I give 4 out of 5 because - be careful washing this little baby, the blades (surprise!)",[]
are sharp.,[]
Getting older and don't have patience or physical ability to do a lot of things by hand anymore.,[]
Find this little food processor to be just what the doctor ordered!,[]
Excellent for smaller portions for individual needs.,[]
"I bought this to replace a slightly different model, and made small batch of pesto for pasta the first night and it was perfect.",[]
It grinds my garden herbs perfectly and quickly.,[]
Processor is easy to store and get out of cabinet to use.,[]
"I highly recommend it, don't hesitate to buy it.",[]
Premium shipping was fast as always from Amazon.,[]
I bought this as a gift for my son.,[]
He thinks it's great and uses it all of the time.,[]
We bought this for making home made baby food when our daughter arrived.,[]
"We pureed all kinds of fruits and vegetables, pasta, rice and some meat.",[]
Usually with great results (hard fruits and big chunks take a bit of work).,[]
"It's convenient to use and easy to clean, but it does a lousy job of what I use it for most, which is chopping nuts and onions.",[]
The pieces it produces are inconsistent in size and a moment of over-processing to overcome this deficit can result in a mush of onion or a mound of powdered nuts (which is not good for brownies).,[]
"My advice: put your money into a good knife and board, and do it yourself.",[]
This is the biggest piece of crap!,[]
Unless every piece is perfectly locked in place this stupid thing will not run.,[]
I don't have time for that when I need to quickly chop up baby food.,[]
It went back immediately!,[]
I bought this product for making baby food for my daughter and I love it.,[]
It is nice and small so I can leave it on the counter and not have to put it away all the time.,[]
I also love that it is easy to take apart and put back together for easy cleaning.,[]
This food processor is very handy for the kitchen cabinet.,[]
"I use it all the time for chopping onions, white crackers, and small things.",[]
As usual Amazon did it's thing and got this mini chopper out to us in a jiffy.,[]
"Now, do it chop.",[]
"Yep, it do a mighty fine job and with very little effort!",[]
"Sliced 1"" thick and quartered a nice size purple union.",[]
"Zap, zap, zap with the neat lever and wa-la, fine chopped union with no juice.",[]
"Took three sweet pickles and zap, zap, zap again and got finely chopped pickles with no juice, ya-hooo.",[]
"Hummmm, gotta get out tha Gum-mbo pot now.",[]
Get to tha store and get some assorted goodies.,[]
"Hey, it's File Gumbo time and I'm gonna be ""King of tha Kitchen"" again.",[]
"Now ladies, sorry!",[]
"Your he-man is gonna lay claim to this here ""power tool"" ""toy"" for himself, lol........",[]
"Yes, and it's a dandy looking little thing too........ Long life, who knows, but today it's a gooood life!",[]
It do seem to be sturdy and solid enough for a long life.,[]
I figure it'll last.....,[]
"the only good thing i can say about this product is that it does a good job if you want to only chop a few nuts or veggies..the motor is not powerful enough to grind up ice cubes and if you are using an type of liquid it leaks just enough to make a mess..it is not designed to make smoothies or blend liquids..this product is only good to chop a small quantity and frankly if that is what you want to do, i would recommend using your chopping board.",[]
"This is okay for chopping cilantro, but does not puree very well.",[]
I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name.,[]
Much prefer my old Sunbeam Oskar.,[]
Been looking for a new mini chopper for quite sometimes and found this one on Amazon for a good price compare to other department stores.,[]
It works very well and the quality of the product is good.,[]
We like it so much that we bought one for our mom.,[]
Turned out she doesn't like it as much as we do.,[]
"Overall, it's a good product for a good price.",[]
I would recommend it.,[]
"The machine works fine, but only on small amounts of food at a time.",[]
"Example, I can only chop half an onion at a time even if cut small",[]
First of all it is a pain to get this started.,[]
You have to twist the cup just right to get the motor started.,[]
"Secondly, it doesn't do much that a blender can't do.",[]
It took 10 minutes to pulverize strawberries.,[]
"It  is a good nut chopper; however, I am going to dump it and buy a Bullet.",[]
This was a waste of money.,[]
I expected a small food processor.,[]
Instead I got a less than functional mini blender.,[]
"Cheap, Nice Designs, beautiful finish color, easy to use and clean, very small, good to storage.Cuisinart have very good products to make the kitchen beautiful and easy.",[]
"When my daughter sent me a stainless cuisinart mini-prep processor, I was wondering what I'd do with it.",[]
"But once I used it, I was sold.",[]
It's a wonderful little machine that looks great at the same time.,[]
I love it for chopping eggs for egg salad and I used it for chopping onions and celery for the turkey dressing.,[]
"It does a great job for carrots and nuts, too.I'm an experienced mother who has raised 8 kids and I love to cook.",[]
"I like this processor so much, I am giving one to my daughter for her birthday.",[]
I think the rest of my adult kids will be getting one for their birthdays too.This is a time-saver for today's busy career moms and dads.,[]
"You won't be disappointed.Brenda Ritter, Katy, Texas",[]
"This food processor is perfectly sized for small jobs, for those who do not need a huge processor.",[]
It is easy to use and does not take up a ton of space.,[]
Great buy.,[]
Bought this for my Mother who had her version from about 8-9 years ago finally die out.,[]
"It looks almost identical (other than some minor cosmetical changes over the years) to her previous version.Judging from her original version, if it lasts at last as that, she'll be thrilled.",[]
Great little food processor.,[]
"My original mini prep had a sharp blade, not a serrated blade.",[]
"I got years of use out of it, and I wouldn't have replaced it but my husband mistakenly through the lid out in the trash.",[]
"This one is only so so, and food gets caught in the teeth of the serrated blade",[]
My only regret is that I didn't get a Cuisinart mini-processor sooner.,[]
"The three cup capacity is just right; the appliance is easy to clean; and best of all, it does exactly what it is supposed to do.",[]
"I have made garlic paste to freeze, grilling rubs of herbs and spices, minced basil in oil for freezing, and mixed herb salad dressings.",[]
The reversible blade gives versatility and the motor stands up to nuts and hard cheeses.,[]
"It is handsome enough in the black/chrome to leave out on the counter, but frankly, I use it so much I'd leave it out even if it were bright pink!",[]
I bought this chopper based on the picture as shows on the box for onions.,[]
"It was advertised as a chopper and grinder, but it is, in fact, a grinder.",[]
The onions and other items are shredded like soup and are spattered against the wall of the container.,[]
There are no adjustments to control the size of the pieces.,[]
I need this for making omelette.,[]
It was certainly not what I was expecting.,[]
"I am going to return this to Cusinart, and they can keep it.",[]
I am so disgusted.,[]
"The next time I purchase any item, I will certainly read the reviews.",[]
This is a piece of junk.,[]
It is worth 1/2 star.,[]
My mom had a little food processor type cuisinart for years and just loved it.,[]
"Then my grandmother saw it and stole it, taking it back to florida with her.",[]
"My mom didn't have the heart to insist on getting it back when my grandmother gave her a black and decker food chopper somewhat like the cuisinart, but hated the black and decker model.",[]
So When I saw the price on these cuisinarts I had to get one for my mom.,[]
"The white plastic model, not the brushed steel, is what my mom had before, but Amazon was charging more for it, so I got this one isntead.",[]
It is just as good if not better than the one before and my mom loves it.,[]
We are hiding it when Grandma comes to visit though.,[]
This was for a gift.,[]
The recipient has been really happy with it.,[]
Think I'll buy one for myself also.,[]
This purchase was a replacement for the one the kids broke trying to operate it.,[]
I liked it enough to purchase it twice.,[]
"This mini processor does a great job of mincing garlic, onion, chopping fresh herbs, blending liquids or eggs!!!",[]
It is sturdier than its light weight leads you to believe and much easier to use for light uses than lugging out the full size processor.,[]
Well worth the money!!!,[]
Does not take up a lot of storage space and the bowl and blade are dishwasher proof.,[]
I like mine a lot.,[]
"After a month of reading about which food processor to purchase, I decided on this one.",[]
I use it 3-4 times a week.,[]
I usually do several batches each time.,[]
"Depending what you are processing, you may have to cut it into smaller pieces, or tear it up a little.",[]
"But it's a small processor, so of course you'd have to make large items smaller.Love: Easy to store, does a great job smoothing things out, chopping things up etc.",[]
"Easy to use, fantastic price!Some draw backs: Loud, it can make a burning smell.I've never heard a quiet food processor, but then again, I don't want to spend tons of money on one either.",[]
"If you alternate between the 2 settings, I find that it does not make a burned smell.",[]
Alternating between the 2 settings also makes things puree faster and smoother.,[]
"I would definitely buy this again, and recommend it.I have used it for: icing, nut pastes, quinoa, chicken, potatoes, veggies, and more.December 2011 UPDATE: The tab on the lid that locks into the base (which enables the thing to turn on) broke off.","[('thing', 0.10549480957565062)]"
Trying to get a replacement lid has been impossible.,[]
It's expensive and confusing just trying to figure out which one is mine (even with model number).,[]
We still use it.,[]
"The tab broke off with a clean cut, so we just manually put it there and are careful not to lose it.",[]
"Otherwise, this thing is still going and I still love it.",[]
I received the mini-processor as a gift and loved it with the first use.,[]
"The second time I attempted to use the product, the motor had died.",[]
"Can't replace it, as I have no receipt and do not know where it was purchased (not sure I'd want another one anyway).",[]
i am highly disappointed in this machine.,[]
"my old hand braun mixer, with a bowl attachment , chopped the daylights out of anything.",[]
the new cuisinart mini prep doesn't chop at all.,[]
"i tried to use it for pesto, chopping the garlic fine, and still didnt' do the job.",[]
"the motor sounds strong, but the machine is useless to me.",[]
Cuisinart has a reputation for quality.,[]
I found this mini-prep easy to use and easy to clean afterward.,[]
The manual warns about the sharpness of the sharp side of the blade many times.,[]
And one better believe it!,[]
I cut my fingers twice before I knew it had happened.,[]
I now have a deep respect for the blade.,[]
I like the size of the prep bowl and that the blade has two sides for a variety of uses.I hope this mini-prep lasts as long a my Krups did--13 years!,[]
We bought this shortly after our daughter was born.,[]
"My wife was going to use it for the encapsulation process for her placenta...she put a few dehydrated chunks in, and the processor BROKE!!!",[]
all broken would run but wouldnt spin in a matter of seconds!,[]
"dont waste your money, you want something that is going to work all the time, not just the first 5 seconds!",[]
"It's very handy for making salad dressing and other small portioned chopping, mixing, blending tasks.If somehow a bigger sized bowl is an added option, that would be great.",[]
wife loved it and has made good use of it.,[]
it works well and does a great job in food prep,[]
.,[]
Worked as advertised.,[]
No regrets.,[]
Would recommend to anyone.,[]
Matches my full size processor.,[]
Have tried some competitors' mini processors and have trashed them all until I found the winner.,[]
Was a bit skeptical when I first got the mini processor but it is just what I needed.,[]
Use it just about everyday!,[]
Love that it is small and does not use up the majority of my counter space.,[]
Perfect for chopping up the small bit of onion or cilantro needed for a quick meal.,[]
I received this for Christmas.,[]
"When I went to use it, it did not work and had a crack in the cover.",[]
"Returned to Amazon with no problem, even free shipping back.",[]
Great Company to deal with.,[]
"As for this products, it is a mean little machine that acts like a much larger proccessor.",[]
Would highly recommend the product.,[]
"I also own a large food processor (also a Cuisinart) that I use for substantial tasks like making bread dough, slicing vegetables, etc.",[]
"Because of this, I use this mini-prep processor as a backup when the parts of my larger food processor are in the dishwasher or when I only have a small task that does not justify taking out my large food processor.Overall I get a lot of use out of this and have found it to be very durable and consistent.",[]
I've owned it for almost four years now and over that time have used it to do everything from make homemade nut butters to rough chop vegetables to make my own oat flour out of oatmeal.,[]
"It has performed very well at all of these tasks and years later, still has lots of power and cleans up beautifully.",[]
"It is fantastic and I could not say enough wonderful things about it.That said, I do have a couple of caveats.",[]
The first is that I would never buy it as a primary food processor.,[]
It is just too small for normal tasks.,[]
Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor.,[]
Using it in an application like this would take forever.,[]
"However, it's great for doing basic chopping tasks because it is so easy and light to pull out onto the counter and efficient.",[]
I also love how the stainless steel look coordinates with my appliances and other gadgets.,[]
Overall it is a great product and if it ever dies I am likely to replace it with another Cuisinart.,[]
My old standby gave out after 20 years.,[]
This is my replacement.,[]
Exact same model except this is stainless steel instead of white plastic.,[]
Love my mini food processor.... use it almost every day.,[]
Thanks Amazon for always having the best prices and FREE shipping with my Prime acct.,[]
Bought this to replace an old Mini Cuisinart Processor that was worn out (it was about 12 years old).,[]
"Love the red color, matches my toaster and coffee pot.",[]
Works great.,[]
Use it for small jobs instead of dragging out the big food processor.,[]
Burning smells and smoke on first use--just from mixing lemon juice and tahini.Called customer service and they told me the smells and smoke were 'normal' on first use as it's just glue from the motor coils or something.On 2nd use the engine burned out completely!,[]
doesnt do a great job of chopping.,[]
purees some of the content and leaves the rest as big chunks.,[]
I feel like i have to cut everything so much before i put it in its not worth using the food processor.,[]
I have to puree my veggies and fruits.,[]
This is so very easy to use and such a quick clean up that I can go from one item to the next with a quick rinse.,[]
"I have all of the big models, but needed something for for just the small jobs.",[]
"Good product, Good business to deal with.",[]
I've had a Cuisinart mini-prep processor (DLC-1TX) for 15 years and it choked on the top speed this morning.,[]
I'll order another now.,[]
"I've used it to chop nuts, fruits and veggies for baking into muffins, toppings, and anything else that only needs a small amount, but finely chopped!!",[]
"No need for fancy blade changes, just want one to do the work!",[]
This little thing is awesome!,[]
I have had mine for 2 years and it never fails me.,[]
"If you want to chop things like peppers, onion, garlic...or make a small batch of homemade salsa, this gadget is the one to do the job.",[]
"I have the large food processor I use for the big jobs, but 9 times out of 10, this is all I need.",[]
"It works great for combining spices to use as rubs on your poultry, beef, etc.",[]
Anything to save a little time in the kitchen.,[]
Great performance!,[]
This didn't disappoint.,[]
I like the stainless steel body.,[]
Perfect for small jobs.,[]
Easy to use and clean.,[]
I would recommend this product.,[]
I was extremely disappointed with this product.It arrived with a large crack in the clear plastic processor container.,[]
A few years ago I purchased one of these mini processors to make pesto.,[]
I used it only three or four times then it stopped working.,[]
Chopping basil is not heavy duty use.,[]
The worst part is that Cuisinart refuses to stand behind their product.,[]
They said that they would help me in purchasing a new product but that's it.,[]
Why on Earth would I want to pay for a new one when the previous one was a piece of junk?!,[]
I would have given this item no stars but that wasn't an option so I was forced to give it one.,[]
Save your money.,[]
Don't buy Cuisinart products.,[]
Wish i had gotten a bigger size.,[]
Good for small jobs but have to do multiples for larger mixes.,[]
"Didn't make the cashew butter very creamy, which is why I got it.",[]
"Not supposed to eat nuts -divericulitus, so thought this would be a good way to get the health benefits.",[]
"Oh, well.",[]
This is a replacement unit for my original mini-prep (plastic white).,[]
"I wanted to replace the blade, but then realized a whole new unit is not that much more money (about $15 for the blade versus $27).",[]
I am happy with my decision!,[]
I continue to love the mini-prep.,[]
The new one works better because of the sharper blade.,[]
"It's great for mincing garlic, which I do often.",[]
"According to the manual, it grinds coffee also (use the dull blade side), but I've never tried that.",[]
I also chop olives in it and other things.,[]
"I use it much more often than the monster large Cuisinart, which I also own.",[]
It's small and fits easily on the kitchen counter.,[]
The SS looks better than my old white one.,[]
A MONSTER PRODUCT!,[]
LOVE IT!,[]
"I am a fanatic about kitchen appliances, specifically Cuisinart.",[]
"Even though I have two other Cuisinart food processors that work perfectly well, I thought this would be good for small jobs and I couldn't resist the look.",[]
"Not only was I not disappointed, but this has become my most-used kitchen appliance.",[]
"I can mince garlic, make guacomole, turn garbanzos into hummus, and perform a host of other useful tasks.",[]
"It is perfect if you want to make something quick, and don't won't to drag out the heavier, full-sized food processors.",[]
"There are some culinary batches that you would ordinarily need to process, but are too small for a full-sized processor - this item is your answer.",[]
I have found the pulse control to be superior to the larger processors even - you can custom-chop tomatoes and walnuts (a quite difficult task) to your liking.,[]
"The reason that I would recommend this specific model over other Cuisinart mini-preps is that this one is truly a miniature version of the full-sized processors - same Cuisinart quality, same original design that has worked for years.",[]
"I have repeatedly washed the removable parts in the dishwasher with no problems - much easier to clean than any other processor I have used.The only mild complaint I have is that the blade does not seal as well as the larger Cuisinarts - it does make a perfect, restaraunt-quality smoothie, but I would use less than the amount suggested by the recipe book if you don't want a liquidy mess on your hands.",[]
"But, it's better to do smoothies in a blender anyways.",[]
A relative gave me one of these last year for Christmas.,[]
I like it so much that I bought another one for our vacation property.,[]
i use it to make salad dressing and for other small chopping jobs.,[]
I love it.,[]
It is so much easier to use/clean/store than the large food processor that we own.,[]
Got this over a year ago for my mom in law and it's still doing its job!,[]
":) Fantastic.Good for salsas, sauce and more.",[]
I've had this machine for about 10 years now after my husband INSISTED that I stop chopping onions by hand during the construction of Thanksgiving dinner.,[]
"He brought this home and well, I've been loving it ever since.",[]
"I do mostly use it for onions, but it is wonderful for spices and nuts too.",[]
I just can't believe how powerful the motor is in this guy - it seems as if it could grind beef!,[]
Mine has turned yellow (it was white) with use but I think I'm going to rebuy it in stainless steel.,[]
"Anyway, the price here on Amazon is quite good since my husband paid $34 for it 10 years ago!",[]
I think I'm going to ahve to buy a larger one because this one is getting too small for our family.,[]
"I don't like the way it cleans up, however, it can be a little much when you do onions.",[]
You HAVE to put it in the dishwasher for sure if you do onions because the plastic definitely holds the odor.,[]
Wish it was glass!,[]
Great machine for the money and I highly recommend it.,[]
It worked the first time I used it but cut off twice.,[]
Since I have not been able to use it.,[]
Not sure what to do with it now.,[]
I gave the seller a great review after the first time I used it and thought when it shut off was just user error but it definitely does not work now after one use.,[]
Well spent $20 some odd dollars.Not happy at all!,[]
"Bought it for our second home where I try to keep stuff down to a minimum, but still needed something to make pestos.",[]
This works for that.,[]
Tried to chop dates to make energy ball type things and got nowhere.,[]
"Good little machine for what it is, but it's not a food processor.",[]
What a waste of time and money.,[]
"I love the way it looks and it's compact size is just right for chopping veg's for salads, but our first one quit after a dozen uses, and this 2nd one would not start right out of the package.",[]
Cuisinart losing a lot of goodwill on this one.Dan,[]
Very bad .,[]
Didnt work at all.,[]
The motor never rotated itself and no one cared to ask my suggestions for replacement.,[]
Very disappointed.,[]
This processor does not work.,[]
This was a replacement for a Krupps processor and I only used it 3 times.,[]
I had to buy a Phillips to replace it.,[]
This mini processor is everything I hoped it would be.,[]
It was exactly what I was looking for.,[]
Works great.,[]
We love the food processor and the item was afast delievery.,[]
The price was great.,[]
The service was outstanding.,[]
I love the product and the color was nice and sharp.,[]
Brought to us by the same rocket scientists who made the world's most dangerous waffle iron.,[]
This thing grinds coffee like a money can grind a piano.,[]
"Despite what the outside of the packaging says, this IS NOT a replacement for a proper coffee grinder.",[]
"Even using the blunt side of the blades, the best you can hope for is a coarse ground after half a minute on the HI setting; a far cry from the fine grounds that my old Braun grinder (R.I.P.)",[]
produced in seconds.,[]
"The Cuisinart pulse food processor is a different story altogether (a solid workhorse, that), but their low-end products are nothing less than dangerous and duplicitous.",[]
"received in good conditon, had to return the first one,  did not chop,  got the second one, it was for my daughter she said it did not work well",[]
Terrible design...seems to be set up for a left handed person.,[]
The blades are set so close to the bottom of the cup all it does is puree...turned my ham salad into the texture of potted meat while leaving big chunks on the top...AND it is screaming LOUD.,[]
This piece of junk is going right back to the store.,[]
This does not work nearly as well as the Black and Decker one I had been using for about 8 years.,[]
The only reason I had to replace it is because the top of the container was dropped and the clip for the latch button came out.,[]
"I routinely chopped carrots with it to put in salad and never had an issue, The Cuisinart leaves big chunks/pieces even when I don't put very much in at a time.",[]
At this point I wish I had just kept my old one and figured out how to make it work.,[]
"Cuisinart DLC-1SS Mini-Prep Processor, Brushed Stainless SteelI purchased this product, and it's so perfect for my needs.",[]
It's not big and bulky on my counter top.,[]
"I can keep it out, but tuck it away on the side of my Microwave.",[]
"When I need it for small jobs, it's ready, and works perfectly.I don't recommend it for large jobs, because all it is used for is chopping up pecans or nuts in seconds.",[]
"Eggs for tuna salad, and all the small jobs you will like to use it for.",[]
"It's great, dependable and makes making a salad, as far as chopping pickles, celery real fine.",[]
"I just love my mini chopper, and recommend it to anyone for those smaller jobs around the kitchen.",[]
"good little chopper, great for small jobs.",[]
very easy operation.,[]
chops evenly and clean up is a breeze.,[]
cute and compact.,[]
This thing doesn't chop.,[]
It pulverizes.,[]
I tried to chop a green pepper in it and instead I got green pepper soup.,[]
I've been using this almost daily for about a month.,[]
"Easy to use, easy to clean, and looks nice on the counter.",[]
"No real complaints, except that the bowl feels kind of thin, like it would crack easily.",[]
I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier.,[]
"I hope I'm wrong about the bowl, but I guess only time will tell.",[]
"Other than that, no complaints, and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up, and it's still doing what it's supposed to do.",[]
My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube.,[]
"Obviously I knew this when I purchased it, but hindsight is 20/20.",[]
We're only two at home.,[]
"We bought this mini processor based on the good reviews and are completely satisfied with the results.So far we've made basil pesto and chop onions, garlic and herbs.",[]
It works wonderful and has the exact size we need for our small party.,[]
"Well, I don't blame the product, but this little bit of a thing is not what I expected.",[]
"I guess I did not pay enough attention to the description.For the price, I could have gotten a larger processor at Walmarts store with a chute that delivered the processed stuff to a bowl.None of these seem to really work the way we imagine.",[]
don't think you can pop a carrot in there and it all will process.,[]
There will be these lumps left over to separate from the mix.My processors years ago used to slice.,[]
"This just grinds small bits.I'll use it, but it is not the joy I imagined.",[]
Yesterday I sliced with one of those cheap aluminum hand cheese graters and that was great.,[]
It grates too.,[]
"I keep trying to buy something that is easy, like a mandolin I bougnt, but I end up chopping and slicing most often with a knife.Oh, I also found this very akward to assemble with food.Not mucn of a raving success I guess but if I want finely chopped veggies for a soup it will work I guess.",[]
"Easy to store and easy to clean in a dishwasher, but keep plastic cup on top shelf andbe careful where the sharp knife cutter is stored.",[]
Love it!,[]
Very compact design.,[]
Effective for most day to day chopping and whipping needs.,[]
Must have for college students or those with limited counter space.,[]
I love my mini-prep!,[]
"I have a large food processor also, but very limited space so this is what I use most of the time.",[]
"I made lots of baby food with it, chopped nuts, grated carrots, and potatoes the best is chopped onions (less teary eyes).",[]
It is so handy.,[]
The only down side is that you can't get different sizes of end product.,[]
I've had mine for 3 years and have never had a problem with it.,[]
"Great blade, but make sure your careful when you clean it because it's sharp.",[]
"Everything comes completely apart to clean, too.",[]
Works great.,[]
Powerful motor and can cut through a lot of things.,[]
Have used it to grate hard cheese and to make hummus.,[]
It makes a nice creamy texture.,[]
"Motor is quite loud though, especially on high.",[]
Seems to be great build quality.,[]
Size is quite small.,[]
Only holds about a cup of food.,[]
"Fine for personal preparation, but any kind of meal for two would be a stretch.",[]
It is a bit dangerous to clean.,[]
It is difficult to get the blade off safely once there is food all over it.,[]
Also the bowl has crazed very quickly.,[]
"It is already opaque after using it sparingly for about 2 months.Still 4 stars, you just have to be careful",[]
"This is a great mini Cuisinart that comes in so handy for garlic, parsley, spices etc.",[]
I have ordered 4 of them to give to friends after I heard that they were no longer going to make this mini-prep version.,[]
"This little machine has high power and a very sharp blade...every kitchen should have one, for sure.",[]
"Love it, love it.",[]
"I bought this for myself so I don't have to haul the big processor down from the cabinet every time, but so far, my husband has been the only one using it (we've only had it a couple of weeks).",[]
He seems to really like it.,[]
"It's simple to assemble, clean and use.",[]
"It is small, but that's what it's supposed to be!",[]
Great little food chopper!,[]
Has reversible sharp and dull blades.A must-have in any kitchen.,[]
Bought this to replace one of the same model.,[]
A must have in our family.,[]
"The original is over 16 years old and the motor was still going strong, but the blade and the cup were well worn but still usable.",[]
Loved it when the kids were small for to chop fruits and vegetables to hide in oatmeal and pancakes!,[]
"Great for making pesto, and meat sauces!",[]
"Only downside is that you must be very careful when cleaning the blade, it's very sharp and you can get cut easily.",[]
More than one of the cooks in our family has cut themselves when washing the blade.,[]
But it's this sharp blade that makes this mini processor such a great kitchen helper!,[]
The positive reviews of this disgraceful contraption must mean that the ownershave never had a good food processor.,[]
"I have had large processors in the past andwhile they have worked well, they are a fiddle to use and clean unless working on a bigproject in the kitchen.",[]
"This small processor simply doesnt work.This processor simply doesnt chop everything in its bowl, only the food at the bottomof the bowl, as many of the negative reviews (correctly) point out.I threw this away and ordered the Osterizer small chopper (with the motor on top of the bowl, removable)the difference is night and day.....this is the small processor you need if you want results!","[('bowl', 0.13826202906423118)]"
"Had high hopes for this since it was small, looks good, and I have a Cuisinart hand blender I'm happy with.",[]
Unfortunately it was dead right out of the box.,[]
Amazon quickly sent a replacement which was also dead on arrival.Even though there are only two buttons to push and one bowl to lock into place I checked the reviews to see if I was doing something wrong.,[]
If you check the one star reviews you will see the dead on arrival problem is common.I'd give Amazon 5-stars for their easy returns and Cuisinart 0-stars for quality control.,[]
I make my own seasoning/rub blend.,[]
I was using the really small Cuisinart Processor and it worked but had a small capacity and I was only able to so 2 or 3 spices/herbs at one time.I measure close to 20 herbs and spices in one batch and the result is a nice mixed coarse batch.,[]
it was a gift for my daughterinlaw and she just loved it.,[]
she said it cleaned up very easy after use.,[]
also.,[]
I use this little gem exclusively in my kitchen for the small stuff.,[]
It cleans easily and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.,[]
I have had this for about a month now and I frequently use it.,[]
"At first I thought it was broken because the blade would not start unless the cap clicks on completely and if its even just a tad off, it will not start.",[]
"The blade on this thing is incredibly sharp, and quite frankly, a little scary to try and clean, (I've already cut myself trying to wash the blade).",[]
"One slight problem I had with this is that that when the blade spins, it tosses everything in an upwards direction, making me having to often stop and try to push the food back down and sometimes I end up with the top of the food still in chunks while the bottom is pretty much disintegrated beyond recognition.",[]
"Non the less, its still a pretty powerful machine!",[]
Works well as long as only small amounts are done at one time.,[]
It is easy to clean.,[]
Ordered this food processor based on good reviews.,[]
I used it once...the second time it didn't work so back it goes!,[]
What a little treasure!,[]
I have never been fond of chopping herbs and garlic etc.,[]
but with this small machine it becomes a breeze.,[]
The finer you want something minced the longer you pulse.,[]
Great for onions too.,[]
I have no babies but I'm sure this machine is strong enough and quite capable of pureeing anything.,[]
I would recommend this product to anyone to complete their kitchen appliances.,[]
Clean up is also very easy because of the size.Elena Iannini,[]
This works great.,[]
It does have a small hole in the top to make mayo which it didn't say on product description.,[]
I wish the bowl was a good 16 ounces but it still is a great machine.,[]
The only thing is making mayo and running it on high for 2 minutes the machine smells like it's over heating.,[]
I hope it lasts a long time because I love it.,[]
This really is a must for anyone who does a lot of cooking or baking.,[]
I just love it.,[]
I had a Braun Mini Pro in the past that one day just stopped working.,[]
It was nothing compaired to the Cuisinart which has the reversible blade and the high and low speeds and just works so much better.,[]
It really is quite a little work horse.,[]
In my book it is really hard to go wrong with anything that is Cuisinart.,[]
it does not do the job at all.,[]
"I've bought it for preparing my baby's first food, but it does not pure even soft steamed carrot, leaves big chunks and I have to check very carefully and pick them up.",[]
just hate it!,[]
Not for me.,[]
It's so small (of course) and it's really only good for nuts.,[]
It pulverizes other products.,[]
I returned it with no problem.,[]
After reading the negative reviews I felt I had to put my 2 cents worth in.,[]
"For what it's worth, I've owned a mini-prep for about 8 or 9 years and have been extremely happy with it.",[]
"While I acknowledge that it does not do the best job of chunk chopping, it does do a great job on emulsions, spices and (especially) garlic butter for garlic bread.",[]
"By processing in small batches and pulsing on low, you can get acceptable chopping for salsa ingredients, etc.",[]
The one thing I do stay away from is grating cheese.,[]
"I tried it once and thought I was going to kill my mini-prep, I grate by hand.",[]
"As far as clean-up goes, you need to use a glove, dish rag, or (my personal favorite) sponge to remove the blade from the shaft so you don't get cut by the blade.As long as you don't try to make it do the work of a machine 2 or 3 times it's size the mini-prep is a great little processor.","[('glove', 0.08916266806165123)]"
You wouldn't try to tow a house trailer with a Mini Cooper would you?,[]
"ALTHOUGH ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE LARGER THAN IT IS.",[]
I HAVE A $10.00 PRODUCT THAT WORKS BETTER THAN THIS ONE.,[]
I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS BRAND.,[]
"I came here looking for a replacement for the bowl which came with my mini prep becaue I dropped & chipped it, and now it leaks :  I did find this a useful little device *BUT in a very limited way*.",[]
It does not have a very powerful motor.,[]
"You might well not expect that on such a small unti, but when I tried to use it to grate some roamno cheese, it smelled like burning rubber, much like when I use their blender for *anything*.",[]
the things I bought from Cuisinart 10 years ago or more were very well made.,[]
"It has been a long long time since I have seen anything from them which is not made in china, and not to the standards the brand is known for.",[]
I suspect that they either sold the name or are outsourcing everything.,[]
Nothing is the same quality.,[]
I am preferentially using 20+ year old plastic black & decker equipment from when I was in college :(I guess given the cost of replacement parts I will shop for another little chopper from another brand.,[]
"If you generally cook from scratch, these are useful (chopping onion, e.g.)",[]
"and yes, it can handle bread crumbs... but not even a soft cheese!off to look at what Amazon has available from Kitchinaid, Hamilton Beach...brands which are still making products the way they used to ;)Updated 12/17/2011 to note that I purchased a floor model of the kitchenaid chef's chopperKitchenAid 3-Cup Chef's Chopper, Chromeat a local store (for about what a replacement basket would have cost.... they really get you on parts!).","[('cost', 0.05792611951136501)]"
"They were being cleared out, as a new model was coming in, so, I got it for a song; and WOW!",[]
"what I have been missing all these years :O It is so so much faster, more powerful.",[]
I never would have thought there would be such a difference!,[]
"If you are considering one of these, I would urge you to have a look at Kitchenaid's little choppers.",[]
"At this point I have several pieces from each manufacturer, and am quite happy with my Cusinart full size food processorCuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7-Cup Food Processorand stand mixerCuisinart SM-55BC 5-1/2-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer, Brushed Chromebut in the prep realm, kitchenaid has the better tool.",[]
I just purchased one and tried it.,[]
Almost impossible to disassemble.,[]
Prep bowl would not come off.,[]
Especially right after when it is dirty and slippery.,[]
Same with changing blades position.,[]
How you unscrew very sharp blade when it is almost nothing to hold on to.,[]
And you suppose to do it every time for different foods.,[]
Horrible.Quality of build and how its works are very good,[]
What's the difference between the DLC-1BCH and the DLC-1SS?,[]
"They look the exact same, cost the same, and seem to have the same functions?",[]
Thanks!!!!!,[]
!,[]
This mini-prep-processor is the second Cuisinart product I have bought from Amazon.,[]
The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven.,[]
"The careful engineering and attractive, simple design of both products impress me.",[]
"Also impressive is how wonderfully well they work!After reading a lot of the Amazon reviews-- not all 350+-- I was convinced this mini-chopper-processor would be a better replacement for the small, inexpensive Black and Decker that burned out with no warning after one year of very mild use.",[]
Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion.,[]
"Anyway...this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving.",[]
Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day.,[]
The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew.,[]
"Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.What good timing!",[]
I put that Little Honey right to work.,[]
"The slightly larger cup capacity, two speeds, a strong sounding motor of the Cuisinart, and its crisp good looks kept inviting me to whip up quick dips, sauces and icings for unexpected company-- as well as, the morning and evening cat food.The compact size lets me keep it up on the counter.","[('speeds', 0.096633526209691)]"
I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere.,[]
"If it were a little larger I would replace the big processor.Why only 4 stars?I think it is a great little tool, but I am waiting to see how long before the motor burns out.",[]
"And 4 stars because it does not chop evenly, when I chop such chunky things as celery or certain mixtures of wet cat food large pieces are left.",[]
"(No, not together!",[]
I wash it out well between food types.,[]
)Usually I run it until I smell the motor burning then stop.,[]
"That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds.",[]
"Some other reviewer mentioned the burning smell also, so I assume it is normal...Anyway, if it is still doing this before the warranty runs I will have to send the Little Honey back.",[]
"For now, I love it very much.",[]
This never worked for us.,[]
It was a hassle to return it for a (...)item.,[]
"Easy to use and easy to clean (just be careful when cleaning the blades because their handling can be a bit tricky and you might get yourself a couple of deep cuts) but, overall, the product offers good value for people that cook often and don't want to spend too much time chopping things.",[]
I have been very happy with this product.,[]
It works well and not a bad price.,[]
My only gripe is the plastic container.,[]
"The quality is not great, but I guess you can't expect too much better for the price.",[]
"It's very useful and a big help in the kitchen since my gf want me to be responsible for all the chopping, preparing meals :)",[]
I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.,[]
"She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition, but does well with her customary food.",[]
"I tried using a blender, but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.",[]
"We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA, which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.",[]
"I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the ""cheaper"" one.",[]
"I am impressed with its performance, ease of use and compact size.",[]
It is clearly worth the small price I paid.,[]
I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.,[]
"It is perfect for my intended use, and I can envision how to use it in cooking.",[]
I highly recommend it.,[]
"Great looking mini-processor, but not big on power.",[]
The shiny chrome showcases fingerprints;  it's hard to keep clean.,[]
"I have smaller and larger Cuisinart choppers, but the small one is too small for some jobs like salad dressing, mayonnaise, etc.",[]
etc and the large one....it's great for larger jobs.,[]
I LOVE this one.,[]
"It's right in the middle and keeps me from having to clean up the ""big boy"" and really does anything the small one can do...better.",[]
I love it.,[]
This is a great product.,[]
Works well.,[]
Good sizeand easy to clean.,[]
"I have only used this processor three times, and now the blade assembly is cracked.",[]
"A new blade assembly ( my processor is out of warranty ), with shipping, is $16.90, but the complete Cuisinart mini processor new, with free shipping from Amazon, is just $29.99.",[]
This Cuisinart mini processor is just CHEAP JUNK !!,[]
The motor on my unit also smells of overheating with just light chopping.,[]
This is most definitely a DO NOT BUY appliance !!,[]
"I will buy another processor, but NOT another one of these, and I will do my best to avoid Cuisinart entirely !",[]
I bought this to replace a Black and Decker mini processor that finally gave up the ghost (the plastic chopping bowl fell apart).,[]
"The mini Cuisinart is really nice, and I like it a lot more than the B&D I had.",[]
"Chops very evenly, easy to clean.",[]
Very happy with purchase!,[]
"Love my Mini-Prep Cuisinart, use it almost daily preparing my carrots, celery, onions, and whatever else I'm including in my salad.",[]
You've never eaten a salad until you've used this little jewel and finely chopped your veggies for your salad.,[]
"Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar, ummmmm!",[]
"The flavor is exquisite.Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White",[]
A little less quality from what I have grown accustom to from Cuisinart But what can you expect for $30 these days.,[]
It does it's job,[]
"I LOVE THIS LITTLE CHOPPER FOR ONIONS, GARLIC AND OTHER SMALL JOBS...I HAVE THE LARGE PROCESSOR FOR THE BIG JOBS.",[]
GOOD PRICE...EASY TO WASH.,[]
"Perhaps that is par for the course for these types of food processors, but I was a bit surprised to find that many things have to be chopped into 1/2 inch size pieces before you put it into this Mini-Prep Food Processor.",[]
"I can dice an onion into uniform 3/8 inch pieces and clean the cutting board and knife in less time than it takes for me to dice them into 1/2 inch pieces and then put it in the processor and make a shredded pile of onions, and then clean out the processor or put it in the dish washer.",[]
"I'm sure there are things that this does that I can't do or faster than I can do it, like grinding spices or coffee, but I already had a coffee grinder.In summary, I'd still give it a 4 because it is made well, and is versitle, and finely minces things faster than I can with a knife, without losing fingertips:)",[]
I love it.,[]
Its just great.,[]
I would buy it again.,[]
I bought himalyan crystal salt and it grinded it up for me perfectly.,[]
Now I can sprinkle it while i'm cooking with ease.,[]
"I Purchased this Small Food Processor to Not only be able to Chop Nuts and Veggies, But also to Chop Meat, Yes Meat.",[]
"We tried 2 Other Smaller Units and when you would put Chopped Steak in them--the Blades would Jam.This Unit allows me to Take Steak--Cut it into Chunk Size Pieces and Puree it, For my Dog.The Motor Rocks--and there is no where else to Look for a Quality Smaller Food Processor.",[]
"Lets Face it, Cuisinart Actually Invented the Food Processor.",[]
"I bought this item since it has a very good review by costumers, however, the processor I received does not turn on.",[]
It seems its motor does not work.,[]
So I paid like $30 for it and I could not use it even for 1 second.,[]
Maybe it's my bad luck but I feel it is my responsibility to inform such problem may occur to you too.,[]
This mini-food processor is exactly what we were looking for.,[]
"Amazon, as usual, was prompt and thorough.",[]
"The processor works great and is listed as ""Cuisinart DLC-1 21-Ounce Mini-Prep Food Processor, White"".",[]
I was curious why this product got some single star reviews.,[]
I can only conclude that the users of this item didn't RTFI (read the following instructions).,[]
"Chopping onions and garlic was a snap when utilizing the instructions provided, which consisted of using the low setting and pulsing until the desired size was achieved.",[]
I'm very happy with the performance of this mini-prep and for the price it is an outstanding buy.,[]
"Oh, and the complaint about having to chop food items up before putting them into the mini-prep is without culinary merit.",[]
"If you've every had to mince garlic or onions or fruit to prepare a meal then having to make a few 1/2"" chops wouldn't be an issue.",[]
I'll take making a few cuts at an onion over having to mince one by hand any day of the week.,[]
The mini-prep minces so well that it really takes a lot of the manual labor out of preparing a meal to cook for the family.,[]
"Wife love this product, she uses it almost everyday.",[]
Unit is small enough to fit nicely on counter.,[]
Price was ecellent,[]
I have purchased a few different brands before & they never diced up my veggies as good as this one.,[]
Only cut back is the NOISE!,[]
It sounds like I'm drilling a hole in my wall.,[]
So LOUD!,[]
"I love this Mini-Prep Processor, it works fabulous and gets a very nice smooth texture to the baby food that I have prepared thus far, potatoes, apples, carrots, avocado and peaches!I have also experimented with making thicker foods as my baby graduates to chunkier food and it works superb for that as well!Very happy with the product and I saved a bunch of money by not purchasing a BABY FOOD PROCESSOR like the baby bullet!",[]
Would buy again without a doubt!,[]
This is one dumb @#$% item I've bought on amazon.,[]
The only thing it can do blend water with water.,[]
Its so slow and the motor can't take the smallest of loads.,[]
"It's such a piece of junk that though I forgot to leave a review when I bought it, ( I bought this item in may'07) I'm still taking the pains to leave one now.",[]
haven't used this but a couple of times.,[]
"I got it to chop nuts finer, but not into flour etc.",[]
"I pulsed, but the bottom chops the nuts too fine and the top not fine enough.",[]
I am trying to say not 'uniformly'.,[]
But May be great for other foods.,[]
"Compared with many others on the market, this one has a compact, simple and functional design.",[]
"The one we had for 5 years just died, so we're replacing it with another.",[]
"It got hard, daily use.I just wish it was made in the USA.",[]
I would have paid twice the price and it still would have been worth the money.,[]
"This product doesn't chop well at all, there is always chunks of whatever you are chopping left over.",[]
Save your money and buy a different chopper!,[]
This little unit is just what I needed.,[]
Very easy to operate.,[]
The size is perfect and takes care of all the chopping and processing I need done.,[]
And the black & chrome finish looks very smart on my kitchen counter.,[]
This is the greatest tool.,[]
"If you only have one small appliance, this is the one.",[]
Especially useful for one or two-person households.,[]
I've had one for five years and am about to buy another.,[]
Makes a great shower gift!,[]
We bought this food processor to prepare food for our baby daughter.,[]
"So far, the food processor has worked great!",[]
We've used it every morning to puree bananas.,[]
"The size of the processor is great for small amount of food, which is perfect for our purposes.",[]
I highly recommend this product!,[]
"This little baby is a must for any kitchen, from making salad dressings and marinades to salsas.",[]
Just big enough that I use it for most of my food processor chores; rarely do I need to take out the big processor.,[]
Once you try it you'll be hooked!,[]
"I purchased this in March, but didn't have a use for it till now, well now it's as if there is NO MOTOR!!!!",[]
It doesn't work!,[]
I tried and re-tried and NOTHING!,[]
Not sure if there is anything I can do cause it was purchased with a gift card?????,[]
?,[]

"i am tight for room because i am deployed to afghanistan, it took a little longer to get here then i thought but i really have no complaints about the product.",[]
