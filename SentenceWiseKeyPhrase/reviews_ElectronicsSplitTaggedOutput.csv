Fine,[]
I like my nook a lot.,[]
very easy to read.,[]
Text has good contrast.,[]
Would recommend.,[]
"My wife loves it, and the screen is so crisp.",[]
I might just have to get one for myself.,[]
"Product arrived sooner than shipping estimate, which was a wonderful surprise.",[]
"We bought this to replace one that my husband short-circuited, and it's already up and running.",[]
We like the small size.. easier to tote around than the larger ones.,[]
"Had thought about upgrading, but why mess with success.",[]
"It's a shame B&N isn't carrying them anymore, bigger is not necessarily better in our opinion.",[]
I just got this device yesterday for Christmas and I love it!,[]
The only downfall is that I cannot connect directly to Overdrive to borrow books from the library.,[]
I have to download the books from the library on the computer and then transfer them to the nook.,[]
"I know ereaders have been reviewed to death, so I will make my review short and sweet.",[]
I was considering the Kindle with Special Offers (cheapest version) but found a super deal on a Nook Simple Touch.,[]
"I am glad I decided to go with B&N's ereader for the following reasons: nice matte screen; smooth, comfortable, curved ergonomic shape; epub support; longer battery life; touch AND button operation.",[]
The main downside for me is the lack of free books/special offers that Amazon does for the Kindle.,[]
B&N just doesn't have as many good deals or as often.,[]
"Aside from that, highly recommend!",[]
"I found tablets and phones lack the battery life and quiet simplicity of this type of specialised product.Forget checking email, listening to audio or constant distractions.",[]
This ereader is purely a reading machine.,[]
"The text is clearer than a laser printed page and the capacity of 32GB micro SD card means accessibility to 10,000's of books.As with my Samsung table I found PDF viewings unsatisfactory and even maps in epubs were a disappointment.Another issue is that, without a US credit card billing address, B&N; will not let you use your account so I have had to store by own epubs in the machine and find them elsewhere.The unit is easy to operate and had a claimed battery life of up to two months.",[]
It is easily charged from a micro USB connection and files can easily be copied from a PC.The crystal clear text and easy touch or button navigation make reading a pleasure.,[]
There is only a minuscule delay when turning pages.,[]
All in all I am delighted by the unit which is good value for something that holds practically my entire library.,[]
"Book did not work right........wanted to return it, and was not able because i opened it!",[]
How stupid......how do you know something does not work unless you try it!,[]
"I was pretty doubtful about whether an ebook reader was worth it, but this nook surpassed my expectations.",[]
"I love the simplicity, and the small size makes it perfect for travelling.",[]
"The material its made of makes it stay in your hand well, and the features it has is just right for me - not to fancy, but not lacking either.",[]
"My only complaint is the fact that you can't use the dictionary on pdf books, but I remedied that easily by using software on my computer to convert my pdfs into epub before putting them on the nook.",[]
"All in all, this is the best purchase I've made in a while - definitely worth it!",[]
This Nook came extremely fast - I was so excited.,[]
"I demolished my first Nook, so I was ready to reload all the wonderful novels and start reading.",[]
Thanks for the great customer service!,[]
"My nook froze within a few days, as the user guide is ON THE NOOK I had to go to the internet to find info on what to do.",[]
I was directed to the online nook user guide (on B+N.com) which told me to remove the back cover and unplug the battery for a hard reboot.,[]
"It didn't work and after an hour with a worthless tech support agent I'm informed that those directions are for the original nook, and that I will need to get a brand new one.",[]
Best yet....,[]
Removing the cover has now voided my warranty!!,[]
"Quite simply the worst customer service experience I have ever had, although the nook was fun to use for the ~48 hours it worked.",[]
"The new Nook ""Simple Touch"" is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions.",[]
"The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.","[('outdoors', 0.096633526209691)]"
It is July in Texas...so I have not tried using it in direct sunlight.The Nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.,[]
Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize.,[]
"At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.",[]
Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.,[]
"In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.",[]
"The Nooks is at its best with a book with plain text, as illustrations, art, drawings, etc.",[]
look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.,[]
"Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.",[]
"My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the ""fine print"" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.",[]
"If you will be reading books, you will like the NOOK Simple Touch.",[]
Look around and compare price...the price of the Nook varies widely between stores.,[]
"I was given a Nook touch screen for Christmas and while excited, I really didn't want to convert to an e reader.",[]
I love the feel and smell of a book.,[]
"Plus, there is something about seeing the progress, and holing it in your hands that I just love.",[]
"My husband has the original nook, and I tried out a book on it.",[]
"It was ok, but it was big, and clunky and heavy.",[]
"So, the new nook has that going for it.",[]
I  downloaded a book right away and fell in love with it.,[]
"It's easy to buy books on it, share them, and my husband and I could  read the same book at the same time and it didn't mess with where each other were at in the book.",[]
"I love that I can tap the page and it turns, but that's also why I gave it four stars because my kids will tap the screen or it will get touched as I put it down, then when I pick it back up it's on a different page.",[]
I do love some features about it that are much improved over the old nook.,[]
"It's so much easier to look up the meaning of a word, you can have a wish list for books you want to buy, which you can't do on the old one.",[]
I also love that you can pick your font and size of the font.,[]
Any book you buy can become a large print...for those that need it.,[]
"While I still pick  up a regular book, my nook is enjoyable, and easy to take along, doesn't rip or get torn up.",[]
I love it and would suggest it for anyone looking at purchasing an e reader.,[]
"I like this device,  but the software is flaky.",[]
"With 2 months of light use, after numerous lock/hang issues, mine is a brick and cannot be be rebooted.",[]
B&N has offered a REFURB unit as a warranty replacement - underwhelming for such a new and obviously flawed device.,[]
"My experience is not unique, many have had similar issues.",[]
"It should not be that hard to deliver a bulletproof eReader, it has very limited function, not like a general purpose computer running code from various vendors.",[]
Application code/device driver stack is not strong.,[]
Hardware appears to be reasonable.,[]
Would be interesting to see a report from someone that knows specifics about the software shop that developed the Nook Simple Touch code.,[]
"The UI is learnable in a relatively short time,  but not intuitive as an eReader should be.",[]
"The eReader UI experience should be closer to an iPhone experience, instead of a VCR timer event recording from the 80's (like it is).",[]
"Recommendation to B&N, get different software development team with experience writing bulletproof production code for 2.0.",[]
Full rewrite of Nook Simple Touch code recommended.,[]
"I got this nook for Christmas from my parents, it is light and easy to use.",[]
"My only issue is that you can't go on the internet with the nook, but it is still really good for reading.",[]
"I wish it lit up in the dark so you could continue reading when it was time for lights out, but I just ordered a light for it so that should help.",[]
I love the nook and would recomand it to anyone.,[]
"Don't waste your money, it couldn't even connect to the internet.",[]
I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my  time and money.,[]
This Nook is amazing.,[]
"It works perfectly, it has a great battery life, and the fact that it is not backlit makes my heart sing.",[]
"It's tiny, portable, and even with my case fits perfectly in my purse for my morning commute.",[]
"I love this product, and I recommend it to EVERYONE.",[]
When I first saw the new Simple touch Nook being offered on the B&N website I knew I had to have it.,[]
"I have the 1st generation Nook and I love it, but I was always envious of my friends NookColor's touchscreen.",[]
"Now, I didn't want all the bells and whistles that the NookColor or the 1st Gen Nook has, I just wanted a simple eReader and I got that and more.",[]
"I think what I love best about the Simple Touch Nook is how light it is, I can hold it in one hand and if I put it in my bag or purse it doesn't weigh it down.",[]
The touch screen is very responsive and makes turning pages a whole lot more simpler than my 1st gen Nook.,[]
The e-ink seems a little bit more crisper than on the 1st gen Nook and being able to adjust the font size is great!,[]
"I do miss the replaceable battery of the 1st Gen Nook, but the battery life on the Simple Touch is amazing!",[]
I got mine on June 3rd and charged it up to 100% and I haven't charged it since.,[]
"Now of course I don't read as much as some do...I maybe average about 1 hour a day, but to go almost an entire month and not have to charge the battery is amazing.",[]
"I wish they would offer a silicone frame for it, because the cover I have for it adds more weight.",[]
"I will say that a cover really isn't necessary, the Simple Touch front has a rubberized frame that invites you to use without a cover though you might just want to use a cover for protection when you're not reading.",[]
It's just a wonderful eReader.,[]
Good price but no back light adjustment.,[]
"Have been using for over a year now and for my purpose, it is great.",[]
I like to read and I don't need the extra fluff that comes on the ones that include wi-fi.,[]
Great for the value!,[]
I love this ereader.,[]
"I used kindles sony readers - this one's got very fast and responsive screen, the brightest eink screen i've seen so far.",[]
The limitations though are terrible.,[]
"So you'd better jailbreak the sucker, which i did.",[]
"Now i've got Kindle app, FB2 reading app, opera, email apps.",[]
Bible Youversion offline app!,[]
It's just Awesome!The only pro i see is that it does not fit in your pocket :(,[]
"I only wanted a small simple little e-reader, so this was perfect for me.",[]
"Everywhere I go, I like to read.",[]
"It's lightweight, so I can take it everywhere....",[]
It's also easy to use.,[]
Not high tech at all.,[]
This is an excellent product.,[]
Bought as a present for my daughter.,[]
She loves it and does not want to put it down.,[]
I highly recommend.,[]
This little guy fits perfectly in my purse.,[]
I love it!,[]
It's not usable on the internet for browsing or my amazon books that I can get on my bigger nook with an app.,[]
"But it's great to take on the go, the batter lasts a long time and you can read with it outside.",[]
"It is good, but very slow, and definitely needs a backlight.",[]
It is good for entry but a bit disappointing.,[]
Originally I had liked the Nook products.,[]
"Nice touch screen, easy to use, great readability.",[]
The only problem?...,[]
THEY BREAK EASILY!I've bought two Nooks in the past year and a half.,[]
"The first one the simple touch e-reader, the second the simple touch e-reader with glow.",[]
Both of them broke within a few months of use.,[]
"The first one I considered to be my fault, the second one fell and although the drop was only two and a half feet, and the nook had a case (bought from Barnes and Noble for the Nook), the screen now no longer works.",[]
"The image it projects looks like shattered glass with parts of the screen changing and the rest stuck in the same image as it was when it fell.I told a coworker about it that day when she asked me where's my nook, since I always have it with me for breaks.","[('looks', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"She found it funny mine had broken so easily, and then gushed that her Pantech(a much cheaper e-reader from walmart) had survived falling off a second floor patio.I wouldn't be as mad, but when I called customer service they said they couldn't do anything because the problem hadn't been ""internal"".",[]
"I asked to speak to the supervisor, who gave me the same song and dance as the customer rep before had done.",[]
I asked him to total up how much money I've spent on e-books in the last year and a half.,[]
It totaled up to 600 dollars.,[]
I spent about 190 or so on the simple touch since I had gotten a case and some other stuff with it.,[]
The simple touch with glow I got when first came out at 160 ordering from barnesandnoble.com.,[]
"That's 960 dollars I've spent in a year and a half on books, and their customer service didn't even bother offering me a replacement or even as much as a discount on getting a new e-reader.I'm an avid reader and love reading in my free time, or whenever I have to wait for something.","[('year', 0.096633526209691)]"
I would assume most people buying an e-reader would want to take theirs with them outside of the house.,[]
"I try to take real good care of my things, but sometimes things drop.",[]
They should be able to withstand a little wear and tear without breaking.,[]
"The fact my phone can withstand flying out of my hand onto concrete, while a simple e-reader can't withstand a two and a half foot drop, is ridiculous.",[]
no problems whatsoever!,[]
"Came in a sleeve with its own charger and after it was charged up, it worked beautifully!",[]
"Fast, super, amazing!I suggest this ebooks reader and BlueProton shop.Nook is fantastic, you can root it and have more from it",[]
Great seller and great product,[]
New Nook eReader is definitely better than Kindle.,[]
"* Expandable storage slot* Excellent support for open book formats* Touch screen* Even smaller and compact.If you are OK with 6 to 8 hours of battery, go for Nook Color and root it.",[]
Refurbished ones costs 150-170$.,[]
"It is an excellent choice in-between eReaders and Android tablets.Kindle 3G option is attractive for a tablet, but not an eReader.",[]
I bought three of these.,[]
I was very very happy of the performance with the original 1.0.1 firmware.,[]
"However, two of them already upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware, which immediately erased the ability to use the ""look"" functions as internet browser.One of the readers frost during update and it doesn't recognize the ""nook"" menu button anymore...I will return it, luckily it is within the original retail return period.The second reader seems OK.",[]
"It is less responsive now though, after the ""upgrade""...Will test it with imported through Callibre books tonight, if it is still OK after firmware update.The third reader hasn't updated yet, I don't know why.",[]
I will return it anyway - I don't want to take the risk.Conclusion: B&N; completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update.,[]
"It is definitely not worth the money right now.I have the first generation Nook too, and in general I preferred Nook due to the epub support.",[]
"I integrated with Callibre and used embedded fonts for non-Latin epub books.I promoted my Nook readers to friends until this firmware update, because of the OK hardware and epub support.",[]
"However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.",[]
It is OK if given free for a brand new unit.,[]
"This is really cool e-book.The text is better to read if sun is brighter.-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-Linux inside - lucky outside.",[]
"During hollidays, spent under the bright sun with my iPad as a reading device, I was jealously looking at the people using proper e-book readers.",[]
"Searching for the best matching one, I've found 2 interesting: Barnes & Noble Nook Touch and Kobo Touch.",[]
"My decision was based on the page-turning knobs implemented in the shell, which were lacking in Kobo device.",[]
"I'm quite happy with Nook Touch, allthough don't really understand the politics behind the sale of the electronic books outside of North America.",[]
"It's simply impossible to buy smething from NB, not having an adress in States or Canada.",[]
"DRM coded books can be readed, but without the cover image - probably software issue.",[]
"Few times, while pressing over the word, which of course highlighted the marking (without choosing any options) it went out of response from the touch screen.",[]
"The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour.Well, as a gift for my doughter, Nook Touch is perfect, small, light and stylish.",[]
"For me, I'm gonna wait for an Amazon Kindle Touch device with a Pearl e-ink matrix.",[]
"I recently bought a Nook and when I bought it home for the first time, I was impressed.",[]
The user interphase (much improved over Nook 1st gen) was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list UI of the new Kindle touch.,[]
Holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the Kindle touch desperately lacks.,[]
"Hardware and software wise, the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use e-Reader.However, when I started to look for books to purchase (they were about investing if you were curious), out of the five books I tried to find, I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted.",[]
"I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews, and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are, but the truth is, B&N; still has a ways to go.I am aware the the Nook supports e-pub which allows it to read generic pdf files (something that the Kindle can't do), but one of the features I look for in e-readers is convenience.","[('e-readers', 0.06097556761734289)]"
Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient.,[]
"If only this device had the Kindle store on it...Bottom line: When you buy an e-reader, you're also buying into the manufacturer's entire ecosystem.",[]
"With the Kindle, you're buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer that's not going away anytime soon.",[]
"With the Nook, you're buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the e-reader space.Two word recommendation: Research selection (before purchase)I hope I've helped.",[]
I am so pleased with my new Nook Touch.,[]
I have already purchased 4 books and am reading them all.,[]
The best part is that there are so many good books that are free ( even one OT/NT free Bible)and most others are under $10.,[]
"There is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the Nook has Wi-Fi.I really like everything about it, especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by B&N; or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit B&N; store for help.I would highly recommend.","[('b', 0.11667456658176797)]"
They cost about the same and use similar eInk technology.,[]
They are basically quite similar devices.My primary use is going to be reading product manuals and datasheets that are as a matter of unwrittenrule in the PDF format.,[]
"My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.","[('kindle', 0.11328985549877708)]"
"I would have got a Nook Touch 3G were it available.- No media player or audiobook support in the Nook Touch.EDIT:1) After using the Nook for (almost) one one year, and probably 50,000 pages on the Nook, I am convinced that ebooks are the way forward.",[]
Ebooks reduce paper consumptions and save trees.,[]
Governments should subsidize ebooks if publishers don't bring down the prices.,[]
It is a shame that the price difference between a printed book and its Kindle copy is hardly USD 2.,[]
Is that the benefit of trying to save the planet?2) Those of you who read IEEE papers on their ebook readers may find the free program K2pdfopt from willus.com very useful.3) The only thing I miss on all the current generation ebook readers is the ability to take notes on the margins.,[]
I tried using the cell phone for that but came back to notepaper and pencils.,[]
"Stylus support (like the Samsung Galaxy Note), handwriting recognition and voice recording should definitely be on the planning board.",[]
I love my Nook simple touch but will review another time.,[]
Right now I want to alert everyone not to buy your Simple  Touch from Amazon.,[]
"While I love Amazon, I thought I would use my gift cards to purchase my Nook from them rather than going directly to Barnes & Noble.",[]
Was directed to several dealers and selected Ricks Collectibles who had a great rating.,[]
My Nook came quickly and everything seemed OK until I tried to purchase the extended coverage.,[]
"Apparently my Nook had been purchased in November at Sears, resold and somehow ended up at Ricks.",[]
"Although I purchased it Jan. 3, 30 days had elapsed from the date it was originally purchased it November and I couldn't purchase the service contract.",[]
"PLUS, my 1 year warranty actually started in November, so I got gyped there too.",[]
I never realized I was going to run into this trouble when I purchased my Nook and the only reason I bought it this way was to use up my Amazon gift cards.,[]
From what I've read on people's reviews they love the service contract...if they drop their Nook they get a replacement immediately.,[]
If this is important to you....PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE YOUR NOOK FROM AMAZON.,[]
I am very happy with the product purchased.,[]
I'm glad I decided not to buy a kindle.,[]
The nook have the opportunity to expand store for.,[]
Meets all my needs.,[]
It is a pity that there are limits to America and Canada.,[]
If it were possible to record payment cards in Europe would be easier to me to buy the book.,[]
"After all, I'm very happy with my purchase.Best regards from from PolandJestem bardzo zadowolona z zakupionego produktu.",[]
"Ciesze si&#281;, &#380;e nie zdecydowa&#322;am si&#281; na kupno kindle.",[]
W nook mam mo&#380;liwo&#347;&#263; rozszerzenia pami&#281;cie. Spe&#322;nia moje wszelkie wymagania.,[]
"Szkoda tylko, &#380;e s&#261; ograniczenia na Ameryk&#281; oraz Kanada.",[]
Gdyby by&#322;a mo&#380;liwo&#347;&#263; rejestrowania kart p&#322;atniczych z Europy &#322;atwiej by&#322;oby mi kupowa&#263; ksi&#261;&#380;ki.,[]
Mimo wszystko jestem bardzo zadowolona z zakupu.,[]
Didn't realize you need a credit card on file to be able to load books onto the Nook.,[]
This was a gift for a 17 y/o along with a gift card to order books.,[]
She has been unable to actually use this item since she does not have  a credit card and neither do her parents.,[]
Should have researched this item more as it has not been very functional for the child I bought it for,[]
"The first time I turned the product on, the screen was flickering consistantly, making reading a book difficult.",[]
"I returned the product, as I deemed it as defective, and have been having issues for two weeks with trying to get my refund processed.",[]
Will not purchase from this seller again.,[]
"On a side note, Amazon customer service has been very helpful in trying to get this situation straighted out.",[]
I thought I would hate reading books on anything that wasn't a book before I looked at the Nook.,[]
"It isn't backlit like computers, so it doesn't cause headaches as it does for many to read on computers; it's more like reading a book.",[]
"It's more convenient, however, because the pages don't turn of their own accord when it is set down, and it is lighter than a book.",[]
"In addition, though many ebooks are sold at the same list price as the book itself, the Barnes & Noble site allows users to download many free ebooks in addition to buying.",[]
"This is a space-efficient way for those who read many books to own books; it is not necessary to have walls of bookshelves, because the Nook holds many digital versions of the same books which one could buy in a physical form.",[]
"There are, of course, issues with it, as there are with any form of technology.",[]
The fact that it runs on battery leaves one in danger of running out of power in a place without a charger.,[]
"In addition, the screen occasionally freezes, requiring the manual shutdown of the device to return it to normal.",[]
"These, however, are not major detriments when compared to the massive gains.",[]
"The Nook is definitely worth the money, even though it costs considerably more than a book would.",[]
"You can't believe how much this makes reading fun!Responsive screen, sleek design, great customization (for margins, fonts, line spacing, etc.",[]
"), and more!This doesn't have all the bells and whistles, it is just an ereader.",[]
That's what it's for!,[]
I love the device and everything its super wonderful.,[]
However ummm the price here on amazon is a bit high its cheaper on bn website or at bestbuy.,[]
"It is as good or better than a Kindle, but it does not have all the functionality for the PDF books.",[]
Probably the best return for the price.,[]
"It's very handy and comfortable, you can have as much books as you want just inserting a microSD card.",[]
You can have even some internet with Nook Simple Touch.,[]
"I got mine for a vacation, loaded books on, and was SORRY.",[]
"You HAVE to use the touch screen, but the one on my unit is really flaky -- sometimes it just works, and then it just won't, resulting in massive frustration.",[]
"It's not just me, either -- when it's not working, nobody in the family can make it work.",[]
"And then, later on, it suddenly works again.Tech support has been useless, disconnecting me twice after it was clear that their ""troubleshooting"" wasn't effective.The software for it is pretty darn mediocre -- it's a READER, which means my family uses it to READ BOOKs.",[]
"But it doesn't distinguish between books we'v READ and ones we HAVEN'T.We can put books onto shelves -- but when we add a new book, we can't just add it to a shelf -- we have to find it among all the other books, and add it on.In short: sorry I got it, never want another.",[]
I wanted a long lasting tablet to read books and it works great!,[]
I would like to have a back light but I did not think the light was worth the money.,[]
"With two or three major reservations, I think that this is a superb little machine.",[]
"I have just received it here in Canada, as a belated Christmas gift, and in terms of readability, all its features match the advertising.",[]
"This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though.",[]
"The WiFi is locked into Barnes & Noble, only.",[]
"There is no ""period"", or ""dot"", in the numerical keyboard, so it is not possible to enter another url, either to make a purchase from another bookseller, or, more importantly from my point of view, to log on to the local library (this would appear to apply to local US libraries as well; what a waste of WiFi!).",[]
You have to download everything onto your PC and transfer via the cable included.,[]
"Also, you cannot make a purchase with B&N; from outside the US, on this machine.",[]
"I don't mind the latter, as I rarely purchase books, anway, but I am disappointed that all these details are not made more clear in the advertising.It took hours and hours for the battery to make its initial charge from my PC.",[]
You can see from the package that there was once a space in it for a wall outlet adapter (the holes for the prongs have been taped over).,[]
"Making this a separate accessory is obviously a cost-savings measure for B&N;, a poor comparison with other companies which automatically include an adapter with their e-readers.Finally, the support phone number provided for outside the US won't go through to a live body.",[]
"Just as you reach that stage, the call is terminated with a statement that the transfer cannot be completed and you get the dialling tone.",[]
I hope people calling from within the US have better luck.,[]
It was a little spendy (because I can be cheap) but the overall product was great!,[]
Didn't want to deal with the return when I got another one for less.,[]
So I gave it to my other sister.,[]
They both love their nooks.,[]
"I purchased the kindle because I thought that it would be easier to get service at B&N;, as well as the basic version because it might have less issues.",[]
I was wrong.,[]
"While some people might have gotten a good nook, I got the worst one imaginable.",[]
"I am unable to get the books that I purchased on to my nook, unless I am plugged into my computer and put them on manually.",[]
"It constantly freezes, sometimes 5 plus times a night.",[]
"Whenever I call they have me go to the store, and when I go to the store they have me call.",[]
"It is the worst service I have ever received, the nook rarely works the way it should, and every night when I am trying to read in bed, and think towards the money that I am saving up to buy a Kindle.Do yourselves a favor, and DO NOT BUY A NOOK!",[]
"If you get the one that doesn't work, it is impossible to remedy, and you are out a bunch of money.",[]
"I never write product reviews, but this thing is so awful, the customer service so bad, I made an exception.",[]
I wasted three entire days on the phone (my Christmas holiday) with customer service in some foreign country and they never could get the Wi-fi running.,[]
They had no clue.,[]
None of them.,[]
All they wanted to do was get off the phone with me so they could NOT help someone else.,[]
"They kept telling me to take the Nook to the nearest store, which was two hours away.",[]
"So I took it to the B&N store and they said, yeah, we get a lot of that.",[]
"Needless to say, they couldn't help me.",[]
I couldn't get my money back either.,[]
Just four Gift Cards.,[]
Do Not Buy A Nook.,[]
Buy a Kindle instead.,[]
I have had my BN Nook Simple Touch for about a year now.,[]
I love it.,[]
It's simple to use.,[]
Light and easy to carry around.,[]
Things I have problems with is the fact that after only a year the screen isn't as sensitive and neither are the buttons.,[]
Occasionally I'll have to touch it more than once to turn the page.,[]
"Additionally I don't have the Glow Light, but if the Glow Light was of better quality, I probably would have purchased that version instead.",[]
I could definitely use a light on my Nook.A Nook is definitely a great product if you're looking for a e-ink reader without the annoying backlight that you get from computers and tablets.,[]
"For what I wanted it to do, namely display some of the pdf files and books that I already have on hand, this does a pretty poor job of it.",[]
The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf.,[]
"There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you.",[]
"The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there.",[]
"The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the ""top 100"" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work.",[]
"The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device.",[]
"Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.",[]
You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default.,[]
"The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N; were just being lazy when putting it together.",[]
"Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software.",[]
I would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default.,[]
"I liked the Nook Simple Touch that I purchased and the price was right, but I purchased this model by mistake.",[]
I thought it had the glow light and it didn't (my bad!).,[]
The company took it back without a problem and charged me a minimal restocking fee.,[]
Thanks for understanding!,[]
"Since I did not receive the item directly as it was a gift for my Grandaughter, but she loved it from the start & I understand does not put it down, so it must be working pretty well.",[]
I never thought I would want to give up my tangible books for an eBook but I have really enjoyed having the book although I still break down and buy a hardcover now and then for my library.,[]
I feel good about saving our landfills.,[]
Before you read my review I want to clarify something.,[]
I'm a vanity person and I couldn't care less about how well a product works as long as it's pretty.,[]
"As long as it works, it's fine.",[]
Also I'm a very simple minded person so I only use it for reading.,[]
And those 2 things are what I'm reviewing.,[]
I fell in love with this ereader the moment I laid eyes on it.,[]
It was like they finally made one for me.,[]
I do not buy anything that is not fully touch screen if it can be.,[]
I would feel old and degraded.,[]
So the fact that they finally came up with this is like magical.,[]
"No glare, but touch screen is exactly what I wanted from an ebook reader.",[]
It works perfect and it's so cute and pretty.,[]
It does exactly what it's for.,[]
Displays books for you to read.,[]
"Plus even if it only works ok, it's so cute it will make up for all the problems.",[]
"Haven't had it but a few weeks, but I am learning how to download from the library, etc.",[]
love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.,[]
No operating problems so far.,[]
Would recommend it for home or away&#34;,[]
The Nook simple touch had made me a fan of reading.,[]
I used to be on and off before but never consistent.,[]
The fact that it comes with a 2G hard drive and then a micro SD slot makes it easy to start a large library.,[]
The weight of it is real light and very easy to use and navigate through.,[]
Nothing fancy it just read books and if you got Wifi you can go to the store and look at the endless collection B&N has.,[]
"For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.",[]
Turns out I made a great decision!,[]
"I used to be a strict physical book junkie, but now I enjoy reading both my nook and regular books.",[]
"The thing that gets me is that I can bring it practically EVERYWHERE (in the car, doctor's office) rather than bringing my huge hardcover books.",[]
"It's really a wonderful product.Here's some highlights that won me over (before and after):-After I charged my nook for the first time, the battery lasted about a month before dying, which is really great!-Light, nice grip to hold-LOVE the touch screen!",[]
"When I'm at the gym I just tap on the screen and it's so much easier to read than holding pages on a real book (which I don't mind either)-Format of the books are awesome, I love how you can see the covers.-flashes EVERY SIX PAGES!!",[]
this feature made the biggest impact on my decision.,[]
I absolutely hated how the kindle flashed on every page.,[]
Huge turn-off for my reading experience.Things that aren't so good:-Touch screen freezes randomly (ie.,[]
when I accidently highlight something)...but it doesn't happen very often.,[]
I'm not that upset because all I have to do is reboot it and then it works perfectly again.,[]
I'm expecting the system updates will solve that in the near future.,[]
I'm pretty sure they are working on it right now!-ebooks are the same price (sometimes more) than a physical book.UPDATE (2/19/12)nook update fixed the freezing!!,[]
my nook has been performing beautifully since my purchase in august!!,[]
:) i am a happy reader!,[]
GET THIS INSTEAD OF THE KINDLE!,[]
my friend has the kindle touch and it's way too unorganized.,[]
I love my nook because it still has buttons for those people who can't entirely adjust to an all touch screen device.,[]
"For some reason buttons make me feel very comfortable, but I do however use the touch screen every once in a while.",[]
You don't get that luxury with the kindle!,[]
I LOVE MY NOOK!,[]
"After playing around with my friend's kindle (she got it last month), it just reminded me that I made the right decision.",[]
yay nook!,[]
!some advice..-BUY A CASE OFF AMAZON!,[]
I got one for like 16 bucks and it's the best case I've ever had.-Purchase the nook in best buy.,[]
They have extended warranties and they are great on customer service.,[]
Or you don't have to.,[]
"Your choice.So, all I have to say is...",[]
I LOVE MY NOOK!,[]
It makes me want to read more books because they're so accesible!,[]
"At first, I was worried I wasted money, but this is truly a fine product.",[]
I really can't wait to grow old with it.hope this helps!,[]
happy reading!,[]
Spent an entire day trying to set up the device to download books from my library.,[]
"Library was very helpful but B&N tech support is outsourced and very, very difficult to work with and hard to understand.",[]
"I finally, after 4 calls, asked to speak to a supervisor who worked for over an hour to clean up the nook issues.",[]
This is the second Nook ive owned.,[]
I was satisfied with the first and even more with the second.,[]
(The first didnt break or have any defects.),[]
I love the compact size and the online capability of it.,[]
You can use a computer and login using your acount.,[]
"You can review books, buy or get samples of books, and share books with your friends.",[]
The all touch screen makes flipping the page a snap!,[]
WOuld buy another any time!,[]
"I WISH PURCHASING A BOOK ONLINE FROM BARNES & NOBLE COULD BE DONE GLOBALLY AND NOT ONLY  IN AMERICA, BUT GENERALLY NOOK SIMPLE IS SO WONDERFUL AND FILL MY IDLE TIME.",[]
"INITIALLY I PLANNED TO BUY FOR MY SON TO USE IN AFRICA , BUT AFTER USING IT MYSELF FOR SOME FEW WEEKS I'VE DECIDED TO BUY ONE TODAY FOR MYSELF.",[]
"Product shipped quickly, and arrived slightly ahead of schedule, even from the other side of out country.The stated storage capacity is rather misleading.",[]
"It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N;'s ebooks.",[]
"That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5.",[]
"Even better, memory card integration is seamless.Amazon's got a great price, too.",[]
$10 cheaper than anyone else.,[]
"Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86.","[('nook', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"It's a little weird, but not a major issue.I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device.",[]
You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files.,[]
"However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.",[]
This is perfect.,[]
Just like buying at the store.,[]
I like being able to read something without others judging what I'm reading!,[]
I Ordered two by accident didn't think the first order had gone thru.,[]
anyway on the order after writing to the seller to see if they could mail ASAP they did at no extra cost to me so my grandson got it for his birthday.,[]
On the return of the other they have been gracious and approved the return which will be mailed back today or  Monday.,[]
They have been wonderful  to work with and very kind  to a senior citizen that sometimes messes up(orders).,[]
Thank you soooo much for your kindness and my grandson loves the Nook.I recommend them highly and I dont give recommendations so easily.,[]
I was a customer service rep and always prided myself at being a caring cust serv rep. Im tough on others because I want them to treat me with the same level of cust service as I did.,[]
Thank you so much for treating me as a person and not just as another order.,[]
God Bless Bianca and Carla,[]
"A few points of introduction:* I am absolutely Enamored with e-readers,* I own both a Nook & a Kindle and have used both of them extensively.",[]
"* I have spent many hours analyzing both devices to determine whether I should committo Kindle or Nook because I wanted the bulk of my library to be on a single device.And now let me mention one factor of my comparison that will not apply to everyone: I am Constantly making notations & highlights in my books, so the usability of the annotation feature is critical.So here is how they compare in my view:Advantage: NOOK* Nook's Fonts are simply Gorgeous!","[('nook', 0.10367578344340997)]"
"Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.","[('professional', 0.08916266806165124)]"
"In unfortunate contrast, Kindle offers a generic Serif, a generic Sans Serif, & something they call ""Condensed"".Nook's screen is crystal clear & glare resistant; and their lovely fonts provide an elegant reading experience.I must confess to you, I found Nook's Font Superiority Compelling, and when combined with the fact that the device itself sports a superior, more elegant design, I truly wanted Nook to prevail in this contest.","[('nook', 0.12900759194502556)]"
"But Alas, there was also a chink in Nook's fine suit of armor; nay, not a chink but a fatal missing piece .",[]
.,[]
.--------------------Advantage: KINDLE* Kindle's Annotations Feature is Vastly Superior over Nook's.,[]
"The Notes I make on my device instantly sync across my devices & my Laptop, and they are also backed up on Amazon's Website.",[]
"I thus have perfect access to my annotations on my PC, e.g.",[]
": to Cut & Paste into my word processor.In contrast, Nook's Annotation ""Feature"" is Abysmal:  The Notes I make on my Nook do Not sync to my PC (or vice versa), and thus there is NO WAY to copy them into my word processor(!","[('nook', 0.163942832175835)]"
"), Nor are the Notes backed up.",[]
"This, my friend, is both ridiculous and a FATAL Flaw.",[]
And this is the reason that the only time I use my Nook anymore is for those very rare times when there is an ebook available in epub format that is unavailable on Amazon.,[]
* Amazon offers a wondrous feature that makes the highlighting of my fellow-readers visible in my books.,[]
"You can toggle this feature on & off, and there is an Amazon site that lets you view readers' highlighting for ANY book--not just the books you own.",[]
I have Greatly benefited from this feature because: 1.,[]
It has often cued me to helpful passages that I had not fully appreciated; and 2.,[]
Perusing other readers' highlighting helps me to assess whether those books would really be a good investment of my time & money.,[]
"* Amazon has slightly better paid ebook coverage than does B&N;, and Kindle ebooks are often cheaper than Nook ebooks.",[]
"* It is FAR more pleasant searching for books on Amazon than on B&N;, and Amazon offers Many more book reviews.",[]
"Amazon's website is so much better than B&N;'s that, during the period that I was so hoping that Nook would win, I would still search for the ebook on Amazon before buying it on B&N.",[]
";* When my Kindle is fully powered OFF, it starts up Instantly;  My Nook takes almost half a minute to boot up from Full Off.",[]
* I can read my Kindle books on my BlackBerry;  Barnes & Noble Used to support BlackBerry but recently chose to abandon us.,[]
* I have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with B&N;'s customer service.,[]
"From this one user's experience: if you go with Nook, hope that you won't need their customer service.",[]
I would like to have known this product could only be used if you have a WiFi connection to set it up.,[]
There is nothing on the box which states this need and you do not find this out until you get home and the Christmas present will not work without it.,[]
I understand you should do some research on products before you buy them but reading the users guide may be a stretch.,[]
"I am now stuck with a $100 paperweight until I get to a WiFi connection.Books cannot be transferred except by WiFi, save yourself the hassle and buy the Kindle.",[]
Much more user friendly and easier to use/download books transfer books.,[]
"Thought to give Barnes and Noble a try, wont do that again will be returning the Nook for a Kindle.",[]
"Here's my take on NST:  This is a very nice, but very limited reader.",[]
I LOVE THE DISPLAY.,[]
That's it.,[]
A real home run?,[]
"Not quite...Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).",[]
"I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.",[]
"(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE.",[]
I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.,[]
"Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?",[]
"Nope, not going there (see above).",[]
(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS.,[]
"Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.",[]
"(If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?)",[]
"I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.",[]
Not so with Nook and you know it.,[]
"(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.",[]
"But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.",[]
"When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.",[]
"That's a win-win.So, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?",[]
Three strikes (it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book).,[]
This whole e-reader thing is bravo-sierra at this point.That's my $0.02.,[]
Just wish I had known this before I spent the hundred dollars.,[]
It was very difficult to try and make it work.,[]
Could not download and purchase books.Product bought 4/14/13 and tried to return 5/10/13.,[]
Claim denied because expirationdate passed for return.,[]
Wasn't even a month.,[]
"Mine worked for about a month, then froze completely.",[]
When it was working it was amazing!,[]
"It took me a long time to want to switch to digital reading, but after a week of using it I was converted completely.",[]
The only problem was that the one I got was defective.,[]
birthday present.,[]
works amazingly very sharp very clear.,[]
easy to read.,[]
prodcut was shipped fast and affordable would do business again,[]
I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter's christmas gift and she LOVES it!!!,[]
It arrived earlier than expected in perfect condition!!!,[]
Thank you!,[]
"OK, I got this thing and plugged it in as instructed, to which it responded by doing Nothing.",[]
"After some further research, I found that it likes to be updated.",[]
I followed the instructions on the Nook website and downloaded the newest version and ...,[]
Nothing.,[]
The little monster came back just as dumb as before.,[]
"It does show cute screens, but not yet anything productive.",[]
"So far, Not Impressed.",[]
"Love it, especially after hacking it to run Overdrive Media directly without using a PC!",[]
Free library books anywhere I have Wi-Fi.,[]
"I looked into this before I bought it, and it's about an equal hassle to set up my home PC to download library books to the Nook as it is to just root the Nook and download books directly.",[]
I have had my nook for about 5 months now after getting it for this past christmas.,[]
So far it has been PERFECT!!!,[]
I am glad I chose it over the kindle.,[]
I have not had the screen freeze thing thats been happening.,[]
I see some people have had it though.,[]
"But anyway the keyboard works well and is surprisingly responsive, the page turns are perfect (definitely faster than it would take you to turn the page in a real book) and the layout is beautiful and clean and also simple to navigate.",[]
Im still finding new things that my nook simple touch can do!,[]
"The Barnes and noble store built into the nook simple touch is pretty good, and should suit the full needs of most people.",[]
The memory is great with 236 mb of internal memory and the ability to upgrade to atleast 16 gigs maybe even 32 gigs im not sure of that though.,[]
But trust me I have 145 full books(and a few wallpapers) on my nook and I havent even gotten through  half of the 236mb internal memory let alone the 4 gig micro-sd card I bought for it so dont let the small memory size fool you as book files are TINY!,[]
"The nook does exactly what its designed to do, (which is be an ereader), perfectly!",[]
"The browser is pointless and has been removed with the most recent update but trust me, you arent going to miss the browser as it was slow and annoying anyway.",[]
"If you are looking for an ereader with a great browser, mp3 and mp4 capabilities,than the nook Simple Touch is NOT for you (get the nook Color or Nook Tablet).",[]
"If you want a great ereader with no real flaws, the latest in ereader technology, an extraordinary battery life, and an easy to use interface than this is the ereader to get.I was stuck between the kindle touch and a nook simple touch but I chose the nook because it displays books better (has pictures and the actual book covers instead of just the title in words) and the Touch screen is a lot more responsive on the Nook Simple Touch than on the kindle touch.",[]
Also the buttons on the side that can be used to turn the page (if you dont wanna touch the screen) on the Nook Simple Touch are great and come in handy!,[]
"And personally the nook simple touch just FEELS better as in the navigation is faster and more smooth than the kindle touch which seemed to take longer and be a lot more ""Blinky"" on the kindle touch.",[]
I felt a greater delay between me touching the screen and the Kindle reacting than with the Nook Simple Touch.,[]
"The only downside is that the B&N; bookstore is not as large as Amazons (its huge, but Amazons is immense), but even so I have still been able to find all the books by my favorite authors on the B&N; bookstore.Pros:-Great, clear screen trhat allows you to read for hours-Very responsive touchscreen and touch keyboard (you will be pleasently surprised!","[('b', 0.12515440060678834)]"
")-Great battery life (Literally can go 1 to 1 1/2 month without charging with wifi off and leaving it in ""sleep"" mode as far as I have seen with mine)-Easy to use with a simple, efficient, elegant design-The ability to upgrade the memory to a larger size-Tons of options and ways to change the fonts, text size, highlight, write notes, look up words, layout settings, and other customizations to make reading easier for YOU!-Light, small design with a rubber gripped back so it is portable and wont slip from your hands-Supports basically all the major types of book file types like EPUB (which the kindle doesnt)-Elegant cosmetic design that doesnt look cheap and flimsy like most other ereadersCons:-B&N; bookstore is not as great as Amazons-May freeze occasionally when you turn it all the way off (this has never happened to mine though, but I've seen it mentioned quite a few times but seems to be easily fixable with no permanent damage)-Wish it had a built in backlight (the new nook simple touch does) but Im not buying a newer more expensive nook just for a backlight!!!","[('backlight', 0.034328925317994266), ('month', 0.02970677392693486)]"
Just buy a booklight on amazon.,[]
"Call me stupid but being that my computer, cheap cell phone and every other media type electronic I have lights up in the dark, I just assumed this did too.",[]
It doesn't.,[]
I am so sad about this order because I save up for a long time to buy this for my fiance' and now he is stuck with it because they will not let me return it.,[]
Very sad.,[]
I bought this from B & N and had to return it back in June and they have still not credited me for the return.,[]
I have called them at least ten times over the past two months and have been on the phone at least two to thee hours each time and they have still not credited me yet for the nook touch.,[]
I am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them.,[]
Buyer beware where you buy your Nook touch.,[]
I must admit I was a skeptic regarding ebooks.,[]
I thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand.,[]
"after purchasing 2 of these for my wife and I on a whim I have to admit, I love it.Allows me to read books more quickly,not sure why, faster page turning, easier to find where you left off, maybe easier to read for longer periods of time, easier to carry with you anywhere maybe?.Adjustable font size so you don't have to squint at small print, display is just like a real page, and you can flip pages with a swipe, a touch, or using the buttons on either side.","[('buttons', 0.0827748537602753)]"
"I can't compare it to a Kindle because I never owned one, but my understanding is that it allows more formats than the kindle does.so simple to transfer books from my computer, or purchase books via WIFI at B&N; or at home, or even borrow from my local library online!can't say enough great things about it, my wife and I were thrilled with them, not really any cons, wifi is difficult to connect in some places, thats pretty much it","[('kindle', 0.08269037038027359)]"
I bought my Nook before going abroad last October.,[]
Big mistake on my part - it started malfunctioning the day I opened it (touch screen didn't work and the on/off button stuck).,[]
"My fault, I thought, I should have gotten it far enough in advance to test it out first.",[]
"When I got back at the end of May, I called customer service to let them know about the problems, and they said I could send it in and get a free replacement.",[]
I sent it via UPS at the beginning of June.,[]
"After not hearing anything for 3 weeks, I called to see if there was a problem.",[]
"They said they had just received the Nook, which I find extremely unlikely since it's never taken UPS that long to deliver one of my packages.",[]
"After waiting another 5 weeks without any sign of the Nook, I called them again this week to see what the deal was.",[]
"I tell the customer service rep I sent the Nook in two months ago, and he acts surprised and says he'll see if he can find out what the problem is.",[]
He then calls someone in another department and informs me the Nook will be shipping out soon.,[]
No explanation whatsoever as to why the Nook has been sitting in their warehouse for 2 months.,[]
"Basically, I've had this Nook for 10 months total and have never been able to use it, and they didn't even offer expedited shipping to make up for their mistake.",[]
"Extremely unhappy with the service overall, and really regretting not getting a Kindle now.",[]
Buyer beware.,[]
It's the perfect ebook reader and plus you can install Android OS to see mail (a good help sometimes).,[]
"Long batterylife, can read nearly all ebook.",[]
I purchased the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and the original Nook (the B&W; one) and tried them out during the return period.,[]
"While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library.",[]
Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR).,[]
I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.,[]
"It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue.",[]
"And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook!",[]
(which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability.,[]
"On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook.",[]
"On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased).",[]
"Touch the icon, and the ebook opens.",[]
Turning the page?,[]
Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back).,[]
Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page.,[]
Or use the buttons built into the frame.,[]
Want to page quickly through a book?,[]
Hold down the page turning button.,[]
Need a word definition?,[]
Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up.,[]
"The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button.",[]
"It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone.",[]
"The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.",[]
"I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.",[]
"The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.",[]
A power cycle generally brought it back.,[]
I started a thread on B&N;'s website about this and found many others having the problem.,[]
I did take my Nook STR back to B&N; and they exchanged it.,[]
Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.,[]
"So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).",[]
This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.,[]
"Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.",[]
"If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the ""Shop"" tab to access B&Ns; website.",[]
"Every Friday B&N; offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week.",[]
"Easy to use, bright screen and since its capacity can be expanded up to 32 gb by adding a micro sd card I think it is better than a Kindle.",[]
With this ability you are practically able to carry a library worth thousands of books.,[]
Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website.,[]
I have also purchased a CaseCrown Regal Flip Case from Amazon at a bargain price.,[]
It fits the Nook very well and is also a beautifull case.I am thinking to buy more of them in combos as presents to my other family members.,[]
"the reason ill take a eInk reader over a kindle eInk reader,  is because the nook has expandable memory (up to 32GB).",[]
when you get to the fire and nook color/tab its a different story.,[]
the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing.,[]
if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect.,[]
"feels great in the hand, the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy.",[]
although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another.,[]
i believe its because of the eInk style.,[]
This is the first ereader I purchased for myself and I have had it for about 3 months.,[]
I unexpectedly found this Nook at Walmart and it saved me a trip to the local Barnes & Noble store when I was in a hurry.,[]
"However I love going to the Barnes & Noble store because if you take your Nook, you are able to read any Nook book for free for up to 1 hour per day without purchasing it.",[]
I don't think any other ereader brand has that advantage.I have had a good experience with my Nook Touch and I have had no technical problems except for one time.,[]
The screensaver froze the first day I put the leather cover on.,[]
I simply powered it off and on.,[]
"After that, I have not had any problems.",[]
"At work, I frequently leave it on the screen saver for hours and when I return to it to read, it gives me no problems.- Touch screen - The touch screen is always responsive using the menu and also when selecting a book and turning the pages in a book.",[]
I like that I still have the option to NOT use the touch screen for turning the pages in a book and being able to use the page-turn buttons instead.,[]
Sometimes while reading a book I will accidently touch the screen and the menu will pop up or the page will turn.,[]
"Since there are page-turn buttons, it would be helpful if the Nook had a feature to temporarily disable the touch screen.",[]
"However, that defeats the whole purpose of a touch screen ereader, lol.",[]
"Okay, I have read about people having a problem with their screen ghosting; in my case I have not come across that on my device.- Dictionary - The dictionary is Merriam - Webster's Collegiate dictionary.",[]
"Looking up a word in the dictionary can be accessed only through the touch screen and it is always responsive, BUT it might be frustrating for someone with big fingers because touching the screen and highlighting the intended word to look up might result with the device highlighting the word above or below it.",[]
It all depends on the SIZE of the text on your screen though.,[]
"The smaller the text, the easier it is to highlight the wrong word by accident.",[]
I have small hands and fingers so I have hardly had a problem with that.- Ebooks(Nook books) - Purchasing books directly on this device is a no-brainer and I turn on wi-fi only when I am going to download a book on it.,[]
It is also a breeze to download books directly on the B&N; website through the computer.,[]
"Before I ever purchased this device, I researched and found out there were several books I was interested in that were Nook books and my primary intention of getting ebooks on this device was by purchasing directly from B&N.",[]
; I do not yet have any experience putting ebooks from a third party on this device and I have not inserted an SD card either so I cannot comment on that.- Battery Life - The battery life is EXCELLENT.,[]
I always have the wi-fi turned off to conserve battery life and I will only turn it on for searching and downloading a book from B&N.,[]
;This ereader is everything I expected.,[]
"I wanted to be a bigger nerd than I already am and I simply wanted this to read, read, and read more.",[]
"I LOVE that I can always carry this in my purse and read anywhere!...at work, while waiting at a doctors office, waiting for my car to be serviced, at the red lights OR while driving!....lol.",[]
"jk.Since I only wanted this to read, I did NOT want much features on this device so that I would not get distracted from reading.",[]
"Perhaps some other ereaders on the market have other features such as a music player(I have my mp3 player for that), text- to-speech(I'm not blind), web browser(I have my laptop for that), and social networking access(I don't do any social networking but I read that this device has limited access to log into facebook & twitter and connect with other NOOK users).","[('twitter', 0.0724135785035745)]"
"Anyway, I am satisfied none of those features are on this device.All in all, I am very satisfied with this little ereader.",[]
********UPDATE 4/14/12**********Everything is still pleasant with my Nook Simple Touch ereader.,[]
"However, Barnes & Noble is releasing the NEW ""Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight"" in May.",[]
"I will be selling this one and buying the one with the built-in light so I won't have to rely on a clip-on ereader ""lamp"" when I read in dim or dark rooms.",[]
I bought it for my grandson and he loves it!,[]
"I little scarry putting my credit card in it to purchase, but the item itself is great",[]
"This device is small enough to fit in my purse , so it is always handy for that long bus ride home and for reading on those nights when I can't seem to sleep.",[]
"&#34;We took a lookWe saw a nook.On his head, he had a hookOn his hook, he had a bookOn his book was &#8220;How to cook&#8221;We saw him sit and try to cookHe took a look at the book on the hookBut a nook can&#8217;t read so a nook can&#8217;t cook, SO&#8230;What good to a nook is a hook cook book?&#34;- Dr. Seuss, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue FishBut in all seriousness this is a quality ereader.","[('nook', 0.09489046648863353)]"
I do prefer my Kindle but the Simple Touch Nook is an excellent choice as well.,[]
"(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; ""Block"" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode...","[('b', 0.0777808102716824)]"
"I don't understand why :(- No Web Browser or RSS reader app or something like that- PDF reader usually do not render properly if the pdf has Tables, Bullets, Images and other graphic different from text.- You Can Not Delete, move or rename Files from the device User Interface, you always have to connect it to the computer to do this actions... this makes you waist a lot of time.- The device has a hidden partition used to store the books you purchased at B&N; store.",[]
You cannot have access to that partition (with or without computer) in order to delete this purchased books.- You can not export your Highlight or Notes from the books.,[]
"Kindle is a step forward with this ""most have"" feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness.",[]
Remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device!,[]
"!- The Home screen lacks the options for fold or expand the 3 sections: Reading now, library and Next Readings.",[]
I have had this a few days and I love it!,[]
It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus!,[]
I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press.,[]
"Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!",[]
"We have only been using the product for a couple of weeks now, but it is working great.",[]
My wife and my daughter both love it and find it very easy to use.,[]
Was delivered on a timely basis.,[]
Only issue was the charger cord was bad.,[]
Reader is great for my wife and she likes it.,[]
Bought for my wife and she enjoyed the ease of use including touch response.,[]
battery life and built-in dictionary.Only disappointment was inability to delete books from Nook unless connected to computer.,[]
Overall very satisfied.,[]
"Though I bought the refurbished, it works pretty well and at least there's nothing wrong by now.",[]
Actually now we have more choices when choosing a e-book.,[]
but it will serve the purpose of replacing paperbacks for my son who is in the military.,[]
"Convenient sized, easy to use after the software issue was resolved.",[]
The online support was very patient in helping me figure out why I couldn't connect and how to download the required software update.,[]
Works fine now.,[]
I bought mine in Nov 2012 and it lasted until Mar 2014.,[]
"I called BN to see what they could do for me, they offered a replacement exchange since it was out of warranty for $55.",[]
"Pretty horrible deal.That said, the display is nice and easy on the eyes, which is why I gave it 3 stars.Seems like Amazon has more books and with my prime subscription, it only makes sense to go with a kindle now.",[]
Farewell BN.,[]
Hello Amazon!,[]
I enjoyed the original Nook.,[]
"I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use.",[]
"I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible.",[]
Simply hard to press the buttons down.,[]
"They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen.",[]
"Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back.",[]
"I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting.",[]
Nope.,[]
"It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back.",[]
No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service.,[]
"It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms.",[]
"Well, okay then.",[]
I have the older edition Nook and wanted the newer one because it is much lighter in weight.,[]
Could not beat the price and got it really quickly.,[]
"So far, it is everything I expected.",[]
Good for reading if you buy the books from Barnes and noble.,[]
I found d it to be very tedious to borrow books on this device.,[]
"I was very disappointed , it was not in as good as it.",[]
Claimed to be the screen blinks and and will not let u read the books  that I  bought for it ...,[]
"It was a Christmas Gift for my grand daughterShe was very excited to receive ,,,, and she can not even use it because it will not work....",[]
Unboxed the Nook.,[]
Charged it up.,[]
Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will.,[]
And it won't work at all until you register it.,[]
Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue.,[]
I'm calling the B&N; tech people.,[]
If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back.,[]
I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems.,[]
I have better things to do.Update: Customer service didn't help.,[]
Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn't look at it.,[]
I figured if the battery can't hold a charge for that long than I didn't want the device.,[]
The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping.,[]
"This thing cost me time and money, a bad experience all  around.",[]
"I'll never buy a B & N product again, certainly not from a third party seller.",[]
I've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony.,[]
Hopefully I'll have better luck,[]
I did enjoy it for a while but the limitations were to great.,[]
It did as it was supposed to and still worked ( after a little calibrating ) after working its way out from under the bungee on my motorcycle and doing a couple of end over ends.,[]
Finally I bought an E Book and gave the nook to my grandson.,[]
My daughter says he loves it,[]
We bought one of these for my mother-in-law hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use.,[]
It has been nothing but a pain.,[]
Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library.,[]
"This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software.",[]
"Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws.",[]
What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook.,[]
There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself.,[]
"Otherwise, it is nothing but frustrating.",[]
EDIT:  A year later...  the page buttons on the right side stick or don't work most of the time.,[]
"B&N; is replacing it within their 1 year warrantee.The first one I got was bad out of the box, a quick exchange and there were no problems (this happens people, there is nothing to be done about it you just have to suck it up).The next one worked wonders.So I love the touch screen, just tapping the right edge of the screen to change pages is great.",[]
The display is crisp.,[]
I like that you now have the option of how big you want your margins.,[]
There are far fewer add ins than the first generation had and I don't miss them at all.,[]
"However, I think the library is more difficult to browse now, and you have no choice but to set up folders.The battery life is amazing.",[]
"I've had it for about 2 months, I have charged it three times and I read at least 4-6 hours a day with it.No AC charging adapter with it, just a USB cable.",[]
"Cheap morons, but whatever, I have an adapter from my HTC phone charger anyway.I don't like any of the accessories B&N; offers so I bought a rooCase from Amazon for it.",[]
Love that.,[]
With this reader you can get reading materials in many ways.,[]
This flexibility and the low price make it a very good choice for those buyers who want a dedicated reader.,[]
"It is light, comfortable, can be used in full daylight with no glare.",[]
Battery life is outstanding.,[]
"You can buy ebooks from anywhere, download from Project Gutenberg or borrow from the local library and using adobe digital editions manage your library on the Nook.",[]
Buy from B&N; and it is all automatically added to your reader.,[]
"Easy.Also, for those technically savvy and geeky, it can be rooted to a very basic Android tablet with limited functionality (email, light browsing).",[]
I've been deployed for a bit and can definitely appreciate a speedy shipment from the states (5-8 days).,[]
If it's that fast to get to a whole other country I can only imagine the quickness in the states.,[]
My brand new nook arrived with not one hiccup and expect nothing less from Amazon.,[]
"Yes, the Nook Simple Touch is a lovely little ereader - when it works.",[]
"I bought one last year while living in the US, and soon after the screen startet freezing on a regular basis, requiring a hard reset to start working again.",[]
"Then after a while the customer service kindly send me a new one, which soon after had the exact same problem - only even worse.",[]
"Now I am back in Europe and stuck with a useless device, and there seems to be no repair solution!",[]
"B&N; stop sending people defect products, it would save a lot of effort in the first place.",[]
I would highly recommend this item to anyone just wanting an e-reader it's great!!,[]
It arrived very quickly and in great shape.,[]
Everything about this purchase was perfect!,[]
Arrived on time and product was as described.,[]
Would do business whit them again.,[]
"Great e-reader!The user interface is great, atractive, smooth and clean!",[]
There were only 2 minnor issues:1.,[]
"The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N; support page fixed that.2.",[]
"The description says that the device has a 2GB internal memory, the one I got doesn't have that amount of memory.",[]
"Probably someone forgot to insert the 2GB SD Card in the device, but that's not a big deal!Overrall, great device!!",[]
!,[]
Easy to use.,[]
I got it mainly for the ability to adjust the font size for easier reading as the public library has a limited number of large print books.,[]
When we travel I don't have to lug around 3-4 books.,[]
The Nook fits easily in a small travel bag or purse.,[]
i love this nook because unlike other nooks its just a book soo it helps me stay focus and my readinggrade went up from a 70 2 a 93,[]
Got a Nook Simple Touch about a month ago.,[]
I successfully set up the WiFi to communicate with my home WAP-protected router.,[]
"After that first time, WiFi never worked again.",[]
It always says the connection was unsuccessful.,[]
Obviously the password and SSID were correct since it worked the first time.,[]
"Wiped out the old settings, re-entered everything: no dice.",[]
This device has buggy wireless software so I do not recommend it unless you are willing to always download your books from a USB connection to a wired computer.,[]
"Honestly, that USB download process is buggy too.",[]
"At first, a downloaded book showed up on the USB Nook-drive icon on the computer, where I drag-and-dropped it into the Library folder, and would NOT show up in the Nook library display.",[]
But then a few days later it decided to show up on the Library list on the Nook too.,[]
I have 3 computers on secure home wireless and they all worked the first time and 100% of the time after too.,[]
Not the Nook.,[]
It's at 3% and going down.,[]
At least it can still read a book which somehow actually got downloaded.,[]
"From what I've read, calling B&N tech support is a waste of time.",[]
"Besides, I'm an experienced electronics engineer.",[]
It's not like I've never done this stuff before.,[]
"Garbage software, grossly inadequate SW QA.",[]
Rec'd item in good order.,[]
New in the box item.,[]
"No problems with seller or shipping, but the Kindle itself seems to be cheap quality.",[]
Flickers when going from one page to another.,[]
No back lighting so you must have a light on when reading.,[]
"It is lightweight and easy to hold compared to an I-Pad, but knowing what I know now I would have bought another I-Pad.",[]
First let me qualify my comments.,[]
"If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!",[]
That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.,[]
"It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.",[]
"It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.",[]
It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.,[]
It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.,[]
The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.,[]
"If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.",[]
Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.,[]
Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.,[]
I found most of the time I don't use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.,[]
I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.,[]
It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.,[]
You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.,[]
But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.,[]
If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.,[]
I think Barnes and Noble has a winner here.,[]
Very excited to get the NOOK...until I couldn't get on the internet because it conflicted with my Verizon Router.,[]
"After hours on line with Verizon and on the phone with Verizon and NOOK support, no luck.",[]
NOOK wanted to send me a new one...but they couldn't find the serial number from this re-seller.,[]
The nightmare continues as NOOK suggested we call them back in 24 hours when a different technician would see the updated network and could probably help me.,[]
ARGH!,[]
Bought one right after they came out.,[]
"I love the idea of a simple, cheap(er), E ink, midsize book reader and it seemed to fit the bill as I tried it out.",[]
"After using it for a few months, I realize that its not yet the device I was hoping for.Good:- My setup was pretty simple- Nice form factor- Battery life- Book display looks goodBad:- In-store help was not that great.",[]
"My nook was one that broke a few months after light use, so I took it back to the store.",[]
"The thing was completely broken, but it still took 1 1/2 hours.",[]
"At the end of this time, with the in-store employee having to talk to several different people on the phone for approval and getting ideas for possible fixes and being confused by those fixes, they finally said that I could send it in and get a new one in a few weeks.",[]
That was odd because they had just told another customer that in-store help was so much better than working with Amazon.,[]
"After another phone call and manager approval, who also felt it important to play with the device, I did finally walk out with a new one.- Holding the device is strange for me.",[]
I can't get a comfortable grip that also works for turning the pages.,[]
Not sure if this is the size or the fact that I have to be careful not to touch the screen the whole time I'm reading.,[]
"I just know that there is a subtle feeling that holding a real book feels better than this device.- Cover looks good, but only hooks in on one side, even though the device has places on both sides where it could connect.",[]
"Not sure why they did this, but the problem it causes is that when you use the buttons on the left to turn pages, the right comes up off the back an inch or so.",[]
This means the thing flaps every time you turn the page this way.- Syncing to the latest page read does not work between NOOK for PC and the reader.,[]
"When I e-mailed them, they gave a generic response that they are working on it and to check back with their website, which already said that it was supposed to work.- Gave up on getting library e-books after installing a couple of applications on my computer, several e-mails to libraries, and discussions with others that got it working, but said it was a pain.",[]
Could be a problem just with my area.- Free books I tried are terrible.,[]
"I had a hard time finding a decent one (the one I got  through google books were unreadable), so paid for a cheap version, which still had problems.- Physical page turning using the buttons on the left and right of the device is strange.",[]
"The buttons require you to either press in just the right place, or press too hard, so there is always a pause to see if it did turn, or if I should hit it again.- The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. B&N; battle since the books I'm buying may not work on the devices of the future, and for the short term, they definitely will not work.","[('press', 0.1266746748234839)]"
"For example, I was considering the Fire, but know that the dozen books I bought so far for the Nook will not transfer over easily if I do.Overall I like it, but hopefully the next version, or the next Kindle, will solve some of these problems.",[]
"And please, Amazon and B&N;, work hard on making sure that e-books are device agnostic in the future.",[]
My Girlfriend is on her 3rd nook simple touch.,[]
Since Xmas.,[]
"She is on her 2nd ""refirb "".",[]
"Touch screen issues.My kindle on the other hand, is awesome.",[]
Lesson - don't buy a nook.,[]
"After waiting two weeks, I received my nook.",[]
"I purposely bought the earlier, stripped-down model, since hearing (and reading) about all the manufacturers and design flaws occurring in the backlit versions.",[]
"I also ordered many doodads- a cover, screen saver, clip-on light, etc.",[]
Everything was there.,[]
I was so close to reading!,[]
But NO.,[]
"When you buy a Nook, you cannot assume to use it unless someone has told you ahead of time that the purchase, unlike any other electronic device, does not include a charger.",[]
This is extra.,[]
I wasted money on a clip-on light and I don't have a charger??,[]
So there it sits.,[]
It's been there for a month.,[]
"I'm so irritated I can't bring myself to go get a charger.So Nook shoppers, prepare yourselves.",[]
It's not like everything else.,[]
B&N; will be nickel and diming you to death for the stuff you NEED.,[]
I purchased this nook for a friend who was retireing.,[]
She has had hand surgery and has difficulty with heavy objects.,[]
She loves her nook simple touch.,[]
She takes it everywhere she goes.,[]
Fits easily in a purse or briefcase even a backpack.,[]
It is easy to order and download books.,[]
She even ordered magazines.,[]
Great gift for anyone from toddlers to great grand parents.,[]
Excellent for students.,[]
"Fast delivery, great price.",[]
Own several and all my kids love the nook.,[]
It took a year before they actually used the first nook but once they did they never stopped using them.,[]
This Ereader is great.,[]
the screen is big and easy to read.,[]
there's absolutely no glare even in direct sunlight.,[]
I would deffinately recommend it to any one who just wants to read.,[]
"Great product, with simple yet quality construction.",[]
"Screen is easy to read, and page turns are some of the fastest on the market.",[]
"The big plus would be the fact that is supports the epub format which is widely available, something the Kindle does not do.",[]
This makes it easier to obtain books from sources other than the Nook Store.,[]
"Battery life is stellar, got it for christmas, and fully charged it that day.",[]
"Have read 3 books so far, and still have about 50% battery left.",[]
very pleased with the Nook.,[]
"One of the features I like is when I need the definition of a word in the narrative, I just press on the word and the dictionary opens to it.",[]
Very handy feature.,[]
I purchased 2 of these in November of 2011.,[]
We had a baby on the way and I anticipated lots of reading time.,[]
They were so inexpensive I got one for me & one for my wife.I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great.,[]
"The pearl e-ink display has great contrast, and pages turn pretty quickly.",[]
I keep the wifi off and battery life is really good.,[]
I don't think it's quite as good as BN claims (2 months reading time?),[]
but I can go weeks without charging.,[]
"I've only purchased a few books though the BN store, I mostly side-load them using Calibre, which works great.My wife doesn't read hers as much as I read mine, and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive.",[]
"Holding down the ""n"" button on bottom-front while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life.",[]
"It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations.",[]
"The Simple Touch with GlowLight wasn't an option when I bought mine.Overall it's a great, versatile, light small e-reader.",[]
This thing has not worked right since I received it!,[]
You read three or four pages and it will freeze every time.,[]
I bought one from my daughter and have not had a problem with that one!,[]
Two points only:1) The ereader device is wonderful2) DO NOT purchase ebooks from B&N; as they contain additional security restrictions that make it extremely difficult / not possible to compile into Adobe Digital Edition for transfer to other ereader devices.,[]
This is not true for ebook stores such as the Sony ebook store.,[]
its great use it everyday ilove it would recomment it for everyone wanting to read very easy to use the b&n nook is wonderful,[]
Got a Nook for Christmas and I've already plowed through two books.,[]
"It's a very small, light device with a very simple display and interface.",[]
It's for reading books... that's it.,[]
And it does it perfectly.,[]
I already prefer this thing to real books as it's easier to read in bed with having to hold open a book and turn pages.,[]
The e-ink display is easy on the eyes and doesn't give you screen fatigue as there's no backlight.,[]
I LOVE THIS THING!,[]
The best e-reader on the market.,[]
Simple as it says.,[]
"Great tool for education, and I highly recommend Nook for anyone.",[]
"Despite the insistance of Barnes and Nobel to make us believe that the use of this product is restricted to the U.S. users, I have to say, It works world wide.As for the interface, is very intuitive and as it's name says, its very simple to use.",[]
"It supports traditional epub, pdf, jpeg and to my surprise, it reads MS Office doc and docx files without any issue.",[]
"The screen is way better and more gentle with the eye, than any kindle device.",[]
It's the fastest reader so fast.,[]
The only limitations are: a) the fact you can only use wifi to buy from the barnes and noble sotre.,[]
"b) despite the kindle, it reads no mp3, and has no text to speech function.",[]
"Consider to buy an additional memory card to increase the capacity of this device and to buy it from BluProton seller, they have one of the finest and most efficient services worldwide.",[]
I just received this reader after returning a gifted Kindle.,[]
Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.,[]
"I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.",[]
It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.,[]
"That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.",[]
"I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).",[]
"I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.",[]
"Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.",[]
"In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).",[]
Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.,[]
Email is great.,[]
"Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.",[]
I leave my laptop home most days now.,[]
Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).,[]
Out of the box this e reader is perhaps the worst piece of electronics i have purchased.,[]
It claims to have support for common image formats such as jpg and bmp but in actuality it does not.,[]
The only way it can display an image is through its screen saver which would be ok except the screen saver can not be cycled and pops up a random picture from a folder so there is no way to view a specific file.,[]
If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying &#34;this nook cannot read this file.,[]
It may be an unsupported format.&#34; I have tried both bmp and jpg formats from different sources and received the same error even though the screen saver can read and display the very same files.It also claims to support PDF files which it sort of displays but it will not let you zoom in on a pdf.,[]
The reader also can not be put into  landscape mode which makes the text of most pdfs so small they are impossible to read.,[]
Also when showing a pdf they aren't even expanded to take up the full screen making it even harder to read them.Barns and noble &#34;leaked&#34; the fact that there is a hidden browser built into the nook but this browser is so buggy that you cant even do a simple google search on it.,[]
The browser is so useless that it would have been better to not include it at all so you could have a bit more storage space which brings me to my next point.,[]
Out of the 2 GB on board memory you are only able to access and store 250 MB of info.Another disappointing aspect of the device is its battery life.,[]
The Battery although fairly good at 1 month is much shorter then the 2 months stated for the device.,[]
Had the appropriate 1 month battery life been stated i wouldn't have a problem with this but stating it lasts 2 months on a single charge is a drastic over statement of its capability's especially when it would drain in under this time just siting in standby.The reader only has two things going for it.,[]
First it has an micro SD memory card slot which is necessary sense it has so little space for storage and this device can be rooted (which will void your warranty).,[]
Once you root it software can be installed which allows you to over come most of the devices shortcomings but rooting it voids your warranty and is in no way officially supported.,[]
Rooting can be a long task if your not use to android terminology although if your already familiar with developing on android its a pretty simple process.,[]
Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.,[]
I was looking for a cheap reader and wow I'm amazed with this item.,[]
The item looks like new and it it arrived in perfect condition.,[]
The seller made sure it was well protected,[]
"It seems like all of my reader friends had one so, I bought one too.",[]
It is light weight and easy to use.,[]
Great for the ematerials the library has to loan.,[]
"nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader, weather sony or nook.",[]
"this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader .",[]
"Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.","[('books', 0.0729272089927075), ('ebook', 0.04566397003966031)]"

My nook cant do this.sony prs300 works with .epub & .pdf & sony reader software that you download onto your computer.,[]
the email address for sony reader is inside sony ereader.,[]
"sony reader for your computer is a epub & pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library ,where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook,through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader - prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereader-prs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz, so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi - fi ,in-case i want to pay $12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wi-fi book, but i dont think so.","[('computer', 0.13050335722530665)]"
"the filthy rich would like the wi fi 12.99 book ,though.I thought that the nook touch screen would be cool , but it is kind of a pain the the butt because the nook changes pages when ever your finger gets even close to the screen, weather you want to change pages or not.",[]
"'So,you spend 30 % of you time ,just trying to find the page you were just on, 2 seconds ago.But,after a while,you get used to this and its not really an issue,even though it continues to occur.It's the price you pay for a touch screen.the nook works with .epub and .pfd books and adobe digital editions.",[]
You should downloadadobe digital editions from downloads/cnet.com  for free onto your computer and then download free internet books into your computer file that the internet puts them in and copy the file into adobe digital editions library.,[]
adobe lets you look at/read-- the book on your computer and see if you want to sideload it into your nook.,[]
adobe digital editions will recon-nize your nook when you plug in the usb cord and has a drop down menu button that says copy ebook to nook.SIDELOAD means plug usb2 cable that comes with nook into computer and into nook.,[]
"this cable recharges the nook battery and at the same time allows you to download .epub and .pdf ebooks & files into you nook.WHAT I REALLY HATE ABOUT THE NOOK  is you cant delete just 1 book or just 20 books,you have no choice,you must delete all the books on the nook.Because of this,backup on to your computer any book you download into nook, as you cant retrieve anything from nook.","[('nook', 0.10866673578698148)]"
You must delete every thing all at once and start from empty all over again.A very bad feature nook should change as soon as possible.The saving grace is the large 500 book capacity of the nook and the slot to install a 32 gb flash drive memory stick so that nook can hold 1000 books.,"[('nook', 0.181258362640115)]"
You wont have to delete it all and start over for a long time .nook requires you go to barnes & noble to open an account & register the nook before nook will work.,[]
"The B&N; salespeople will do it 4 you, or you can do it yourself,if you like to read & follow instructions.",[]
"When you delete nook , you have to reregister nook at barnes & noble all over again.most people will be out of range of B&N; wi-fi ,so you wont be able to register nook without a trip to B&N; to get in range of the wi fi.","[('n', 0.163942832175835)]"
I think it good enough for me.,[]
"If nook make a large screen e-ink e-reader, may be 9 inch or A4.",[]
I must buy again.,[]
I'll make it simple.,[]
I loved my NOOK.,[]
I bring to school every single day and have sixty-plus books on there.,[]
"It's great because it's light, it's portable(it fits in my pocket!",[]
"), and most importantly, it has all my books at once.",[]
"It can most definitely be read in direct sun, and I was pleasantly surprised that Barnes and Noble did not lie in the slightest when they advertised no glare.",[]
"You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store.",[]
The book management is simply fantastic.,[]
"The reading quality is also great because you can change font size as well as the font itself.However, on day I picked it up and I couldn't unlock it.",[]
"I wasn't very worried, because the NOOK occasionally doesn't respond to touch because the infared sensors are blocked by dust and dirt.",[]
"But it still wouldn't respond after cleaning it as well as five hard reboots, which were the only thing the BN support line could offer.",[]
"I feel dissapointed but ordered the new Glowlight and hope that it will last longer, because it was just great while it lasted.",[]
"I hope you have a better experience with your NOOK- if, that is, you decide to buy this older model.",[]
Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.,[]
She dropped it and it cracked in the corner; Barnes and Noble replaced it; no questions asked.,[]
Can't ask for better then that.,[]
"Touch screen is very good and grat reading aunctions, higher than espectations, would have enjoyed however more extra functionalities on this model, such as listening to music.",[]
I have had my Nook for over a year now and I think it is a great ereader.,[]
HOWEVER DO NOT buy your content from Barnes and Noble.,[]
In the first few months I had it I purchased about 30 books using their awesome click to buy feature.,[]
"Then back in February, I thought I lost my credit card and cancelled it.",[]
I hadn't yet updated my new card on Barnes and Noble's site when I went to reread a book I had purchased months before.,[]
IT WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD.,[]
I called support and was told that their policy requires an active credit card to access books I have already paid for.,[]
This policy creates a lot of the problems.1) I don't feel the books are mine.,[]
I paid for them.,[]
"I should have full access to them.2) If I buy a reader for one of my kids, they could download books and I wouldn't know until I got a bill (gift cards do not qualify as an active credit card) and B & N has a strict no refund policy on ebooks.3) Requiring me to keep I credit card on file should be an invasion of my privacy.4) What happens if I replace my Nook with a non-B & N reader?","[('reader', 0.06815242300922283)]"
I lose all content purchased.DO NOT make the same mistake I did.,[]
Do not purchase Nookbooks from Barnes & Noble.,[]
"Adobe Digital Editions allows you to ""unlock"" .epub files for download to your Nook and a good alternative for ""permanent"" access to your material is to purchase ebooks from [...].",[]
I looked at both the Kindle and the Nook Simple touch thoroughly before purchasing them.,[]
From what I read they are very very similar with some slight variation on details.,[]
The inability to download epub files was what drove me to the nook instead of the kindle.,[]
Why wouldn't a device primarily built for reading e-books not support the #1 e-book format (.epub)?,[]
"It only makes sense from a business and money making perspective, not a customer focused perspective.The only good thing I can say about the Kindle is that it is 100% easier to download library books to it.",[]
"Using the Adobe Digital software to unlock library books with the nook was a headache at first, and I'm a librarian who is somewhat tech-savy.",[]
":D Once you do it once, it's easy to do again, but it is frustrating.The only other criticism I have about the nook is this: Why bother making it wifi?",[]
The only way you can add content to your device (other than purchasing content from B&N;) is to hook it up to the computer?,[]
:S,[]
Glad I splurged on this (which I never do).,[]
"It is very light in weight, screen is crystal clear, very user interface friendly, and easy controls!",[]
The only problem I have run into is trying to have &#34;nook friends&#34;...I haven't figured out how to hook my library up with my friends' nooks...,[]
"I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad.",[]
"This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire.",[]
"This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it.",[]
"I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad.",[]
"Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't.",[]
"I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books.",[]
"I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook.",[]
"I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand).",[]
"Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands.",[]
"As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great.",[]
"I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room.",[]
"The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads.",[]
A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble.,[]
"Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that.",[]
"I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again.",[]
"Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources.",[]
"Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in.",[]
"I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damageI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months",[]
I love my new used Nook.,[]
It was exactly what I wanted!,[]
Would tell everyone to go get one!,[]
THANKS,[]
"The ""newest model"" is the Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight, and not this model.",[]
"It may be the newest without a light, but it's not the ""newest"".",[]
"Inside 9 months one button broke, another flips several pages when you pres it once, and, finally, it froze on me for good the other day.",[]
"I'm getting it replaced under warranty, but I should've gone with another brand.",[]
Relatively easy to use.,[]
Enjoying reading in bed without the issue of turning pages or holding a thick or heavy book open.,[]
Easy to plop into my purse for travel.,[]
"I may want to upgrade to the colored and lit version, but will test this one out further.More instruction and information is available online, since directions included are very limited.",[]
I will keep this review brief.,[]
I bought this Nook Simple Touch for my wife in June.,[]
For the first couple months it worked great and we loved it.,[]
"Eventually we purchased a Kindle too so we could each have an e-reader.However, the Nook Simple Touch slowly began to start freezing, requiring a restart every single time.",[]
"Because we like the device, I have tried researching everything online to see how to keep it from freezing (carefully dusting it off, charging it, reseting it, etc.)",[]
Sitting down to read is hard enough to do at times (am I right?,[]
"), so I don't need my e-reader to freeze on me when I finally make the time to sit down and read.",[]
"Based on my research, many others have the same problem with this model.",[]
"In fact, many people had the same problem with the previous model.",[]
"They have exchanged theirs at Barnes & Noble, only to report a couple weeks later that their replacement does the same thing!!!",[]
"Hmm, I wonder if the new generation of the Nook Touch is going to have freezing problems too??",[]
"?I have been in conversation with Barnes & Noble management (""object key"": 28817953) and they have refused to offer a valid solution to my problem.In short, don't purchase a Nook, they freeze all the time.",[]
Go with the Kindle.,[]
It works much better and ours has never frozen.,[]
"4 stars because it's really easy to use, you can find a lot of books the battery lasts for about 2-3 weeks (and i read about 6 hours a day at least).The only disadvantage is that maybe i could use a little bigger screen.But in general it's worth it's money!",[]
"Great product, easy to use and set up--after comparing pros and cons this was the one for me.",[]
I especially liked that I could download books from my community library and other sites.,[]
I wasn't tied just to a brand name download.,[]
Shipped quickly too.,[]
My replacement nook simple touch just died.,[]
This is the second to die in less than a year.,[]
Always the same reason ... can't charge the battery ... or rather the battery looses its charge in about 2 days.,[]
This is a long ways from the advertised battery life.,[]
"I did all the usual things, like disabling wifi, and nothing seems to help.",[]
"So, essentially a battery is good for about 1 to 2 charges before it refuses to hold a charge.I really enjoy the device but can't see myself replacing an eReader every 4 months.",[]
"So, I gave the NST a score of 3 star, because its a nice and easy to use eReader.",[]
Reliability issues is a deal breaker for me.,[]
There has to be something more reliable than a nook.,[]
I went to shop for an E-Reader and asked numerous questions at my local Best Buy.,[]
I asked lots of Kindle vs Nook questions.,[]
I did not realize at the time that the sales girl that was assisting me knew nothing about either.,[]
She answered my main questions incorrectly and I left Best Buy under the impression that I would have no problem viewing pdf files on my Kindle.,[]
Got home and uploaded my vast collection of books (in pdf format) only to realize that I had been misinformed.,[]
Pdf files are NOT viewable on your Kindle and the conversion process is complicated.,[]
"I could BUY a program to convert the files or I could pay Amazon ""a small fee"" to convert them for me.I took my Kindle BACK to Best Buy and spoke to another Sales guy that was very helpful and explained to me that the Nook will EASILY read my pdf books.",[]
"No converting, no paying a fee.",[]
Just upload and read.,[]
I exchanged the Kindle for The Nook Simple Touch Reader.They were the same exact price.,[]
"After having had both amount the same amount of time, I already can see that my Nook is KICKING KINDLE'S BUTT.",[]
It has a touch screen and no keyboard.,[]
You can upload a few different file types and read them easily.,[]
It has an Sd Card slot for expandable memory.,[]
"For $139.99, The Nook Simple Touch Reader is a way better value.",[]
I LOVE MY NOOK,[]
"after holding out for so long in converting from paper to digital, i decided to take the plunge and buy the nook.",[]
"i wanted something simple, no frills, so this fit the bill perfectly.",[]
"i researched kindle versus nook, and i'm a happy customer with this nook.",[]
"very compact, lightweight, and i love the ease of downloading books.",[]
Satisfied with this purchase.,[]
The Nook was brand new in an open box.,[]
Works like a gem.,[]
Very happy customer!,[]
Arrived safely in perfect condition.Was easily set up and material was downloaded quickly for instant access when needed.Thank you!,[]
The item is very complicated to use if you want to download public library books.,[]
quite an ordeal .,[]
you need first to get an adobe program then download book to computer etc.,[]
What is most objectionable is the pricing by amazon.,[]
The item is listed at $219 retail sold at amazon for $72 at a considerable markdown making it sound very attractive .,[]
"Yet at Band N if you walk in, the same Nook is priced at $79 and you get a $20 gift card if you buy one .",[]
So there is something deceptive if not downright dishonest in the way the item is advertised at Amazon..,[]
So this first bit is a general rant on e-ink readers.,[]
THEY ARE GREAT.,[]
"Especially for the reader who doesn't really care to consume other media (tv, movie, internet, music) on a 7-inch tablet.",[]
"I have an iPhone and a laptop, but do a superior job in their respective field.",[]
The 13-inch laptop screen is just better for watching things.,[]
"If I can't pull out my laptop to watch something, I probably shouldn't be doing it anyways.",[]
The iPhone also has a great screen and great native video apps to manage that and internet on the go.,[]
I really just want a tablet TO READ.This is where I like the Nook.,[]
Disclaimer I have only owned a Nook Tablet 16 GB before and rooted it to allow full Google Play access.,[]
Even then I didn't like the battery restrictions and always wishing it was bigger or smaller depending on the area.,[]
The Simple Touch (ST) gives me the perfect format to read.,[]
Small design with excellent SIDE BUTTONS for quick flipping.,[]
Seriously I can read for 15 min and never move my hands.,[]
"I can rest my fingers on the appropriate buttons and it feels natural, even with shorter fingers.",[]
The weight is phenomenal and doesn't cause any wrist fatigue.The e-ink screen display wonderfully and reacts to touch well.,[]
I didn't get the backlight version cause I had read about issues with screen cracks.,[]
I'm pretty rough on my hardware.,[]
Software works good and even manages to go through my medical review books easily and do keyword searches.,[]
TEXTBOOK USER beware though that charts and tables are at a fixed size and cannot be enlarged.Overall very happy and most of all I love not looking at a backlit screen for enjoyment.,[]
Seriously my eyes and brain are happier.,[]
I bought this to replace a Sony PRS-300 that I thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning.,[]
"Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.",[]
I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.,[]
Why aren't nooks plug and play?,[]
That's my first big problem.,[]
I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.,[]
The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.,[]
It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.,[]
"The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.",[]
"I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.",[]
I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.,[]
I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.,[]
I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N; as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.,[]
I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.,[]
**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.,[]
I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.,[]
This was a very bad buy for me.,[]
I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.,[]
I did not know how good I had it with the Sony PRS-300 and will continue to use my Sony instead of the nook.,[]
I don't recommend the nook at all.,[]
"Because the Nook Simple Touch runs Android (albeit with most signs of it covered up), it can be rooted to allow the installation of Android apps.",[]
Opera Mobile allows for web browsing; various RSS readers make keeping up with the news a cinch; Mango provides more manga than I can ever hope to read; you can even install Amazon's Kindle app for Android!,[]
"There are limitations, of course.",[]
"Rooting the Nook (via Nooter), while not difficult, does require some level of computer know-how.",[]
"The Simple Touch does not have any sort of audio output, and the e-ink screen can't handle video.",[]
"Still, having near-instant access to news, weather, email, books, comics, and most websites makes the Nook Simple Touch a great little device, especially if you can find one used.",[]
I haven't tried it too much yet but what I have seen working with it everything is ok.,[]
It has a very good price.,[]
I wouldn't think about another one having this nook here.,[]
Good buy,[]
I squashed my first nook in a rucksack and the screen though not cracked was ruined for making coherent text.,[]
They ought to be waterproof and strong enough to drive a truck over maybe.,[]
"I liked the ability to carry a portable library around on a bike to better pursue scholarship outside academia and the political correctness of the ultra-establishment people against liberty, property and internet publishing liberty for differing opinion.",[]
I received my nook for father's day.,[]
I've been considering an e-reader for some time and then coincedentily Barnes and Nobles introduced their 2 new Nooks.,[]
"My wife being ever so generous bought me the Nook color, which was very cool.",[]
Because I was only interested interested in a simple reader I returned it and purchased the Nook touch.,[]
After having my Nook for the past 3 months I couldn't be happier.,[]
It is incredibly easy to use and it's size is perfect.,[]
The best thing is the battery life.,[]
"I have only charged this device 4 times since owning it.If you are interested in ""apps"", or music, or surfing... this product is not for you.",[]
If you are interested in reading you will not be dissapointed!My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that I wish there were more books available that I could share.,[]
Hopefully this will change in the future.,[]
"From what I've read this feature is not available in other readers, so it's hard to consider this a negative.",[]

"I have a Nook Tablet already, but I wanted another that would hold the charge for weeks.",[]
I need that on my travels.,[]
Bought one of these at Wal-Mart.,[]
I had a 15 day return period.,[]
"13 days into it with only one book read, the bottom half of the screen went black and unresponsive.",[]
"So I took it back, bought anohter one of the same.",[]
"Two days into it, it started acting glitchy.",[]
"I love the style and concept of the Nook as well as the size and feel, but seriously, they need to fix it so you can read more than one book on it before it goes out!",[]
I'm the kind of guy that wants something to function well and that's it.,[]
This thing is brilliant at what it does: displays ebooks.,[]
"No frills, no apps, no video, no nonsense.",[]
Because of this it makes it very easy to use.,[]
Download Calibre for free and this baby syncs right up with it.,[]
"Battery lasts forever, and it has the same charger as most android smart phones, so In the mornings I take my smartphone off its charger and replace it with my little nook.",[]
"I am in the military and as someone else said, this fits perfect in the side cargo pocket of my ABU's.",[]
"I had the Kobo, which was a great reader, and my wife had the last nook which I didn't like because it was so damn heavy.",[]
I bought this for me so I could give my Kobo to my little girl.,[]
I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for $47!,[]
This thing is really great.,[]
"The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed, but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.",[]
"Using this little beauty, and loading all of my own books, and PDF's that I have converted via Calibre, makes me beg the question: Why are people still buying Kindles?",[]
I guess that is the same dilemma I have with Iphones.,[]
"Oh well, a fool and his money....  Buy this now!",[]
You will not regret it!,[]
"I've never been remotely interested in e-book readers, but I was stuck in Best Buy during a car installation for hours the other month and saw this device.",[]
It's just about the only time I've discovered something not by hype or searching for a product to fit my needs but by wandering upon it in an electronics store.,[]
"After reading about the new reader for a few weeks, I decided to actually buy one.At this point, I've found it to be a really excellent device and the only thing remotely ""tablet"" that's appealed to my needs.",[]
I find it easy to use with one of the first touch screen keyboards that recognizes my non-dainty mitts (I kind of hate touch screens as a rule).,[]
"I feel like the makers of this device understand how ADD our society has made us, and most complaints about the firmware's limited capacity to check e-mail, surf the web, and play tiny games are music to my ears.",[]
"I just want electronic paper... for reading.Some bullet points about this e-reader, some of which stand it apart from competitors like the current Kindle:* 215 grams* No physical keyboard and low affinity of touch screen to oil* Battery life (obviously) - leave the wi-fi off* Maps true page numbers to print equivalent, should you cite or alternate between print and e-book* Supports non-proprietary formats that can be downloaded from Project Gutenberg, torrent sites, etc.",[]
"* E-book library lendingIt's one of the last things I mentioned, but the high compatibility of formats on the Nook is absolutely indispensable to me.",[]
"I would never purchase a reader that required payment for content, just like I wouldn't mail publishers a check every time I borrowed a library book or a novel from a friend.",[]
Use your own morals.,[]
A big thanks to B&N; for producing an intelligent device.,[]
This is my first e-book reader.,[]
It has lots of good points that others have already discussed.,[]
Therefore I'm only going to comment on the one thing I actually dislike about it thus far.,[]
There is no back light.,[]
"If the screen was white, it wouldn't be such a problem.",[]
It's not though.,[]
"The screen is light grey, so reading in a bright light isn't all that helpful.",[]
"Most printed books pages are some shade of white, and I thought the Nook screen would be white as well.",[]
I got the reader for my 88 year old mother and was looking forward to being able to adjust the contrast to help her see the page more clearly.,[]
I should have done more research.,[]
Really cool and workable!!!,[]
if you want to Read the books it is the coolest thing ever and also there are some other ways to make it more cooler.,[]
(if you know what i mean.,[]
android :P),[]
Just got a new Nook with the deal.,[]
What a bad choice!,[]
I've spent hours but the stupid thing can't be connecte to my home wifi.,[]
I can't even set up my account without wifi connection.,[]
I don't need internet connection!,[]
I just want to read my books!,[]
I will give it another day and see if it will work tmr.,[]
Otherwise I will return it.,[]
Stupid.,[]
Don't buy.,[]
"-- Gosh, the seller won't accept return.",[]
That should have been a red flag.,[]
This NOOK is by far the best e-reader.,[]
"It's light, easy to use, touch-screen, compact and beautiful.I'm using it every single day at home, work, parks, etc.",[]
"And the best part, I can carry it on my pocket.",[]
Nook is simply the best.,[]
Its very ergonomic and good looking.,[]
"User Interface is very user friendly and I am open to put books into it from any source.It also handles pdf in a excellent way (in case of images and diagrams format will be disturbed but except-able), you can change the font size as you so in epub.",[]
A highly recommended product.,[]
I ordered this for my husband who is in the navy and was leaving on an 8 month deployment the day of his birthday.,[]
"I was SO EXCITED to have thought of such a useful gift as I figured we could download a ton of books and he would have reading material on ship without having to pack 40 books.I would just like to know why at some point, ANY POINT during my order someone did not mention that YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM CANADA.",[]
you have to have a card connected with a united states postal code or be able to get to a barnes and noble.. which.. well.. is in the states or Toronto.,[]
so is pretty unhelpful.i researched every e-reader and I really thought I had made such a good decision.my husband is gone now.. and i have an empty.. and pretty well useless e-reader staring at me.,[]
"without some sort of illegal downloading which I dont really want to do, this will forever be just a sad , sad reminder of the time I failed at giving what I thought was a perfect goodbye present.just even mentioning the fact that ""hey yeah, we ship this to canada.. buuuuttt.. you pretty much cant use it"" .. that would be nice in the future.thanks.sigh.",[]
"Let just start off by saying that I have tried the Kindle and although an OK hardware device, the interface was terrible.",[]
"It felt like the early days of the internet, with textual interfaces, underlined words, fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate, and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device.",[]
"We returned it within 3 days.Next we tried the original Nook Black&White;, and interface was much better, but the screen had poor contrast.",[]
(not the nice Pearl screen as the Kindle has)Enter Nook Touch.,[]
WOW.,[]
This thing has a top notch interface... they totally put their minds and heart into this one...  it is PERFECT.,[]
"Touchscreen makes a world of a difference, and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store, personal library, and more.",[]
"On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.",[]
"The screen is the new Pearl, so it looks just as good as the Kindle, with the added benefit of touchscreen!The size?",[]
PERFECT!,[]
"Not too big, not too small.",[]
Very thin.,[]
Well built.,[]
"Feels durable.All I can say is this is finally the ereader I've been waiting for...  excellent battery life, good Pearl screen, touchscreen, and perfect size.To boot, the price is dead on!",[]
$139 with Wifi.,[]
"If it gets stolen, I am buying another one immediately!",[]
Just a short review of my two weeks with the Nook Simple Touch.,[]
This looked the the reader to get when it came out.,[]
Specifically for me the touch screen was a must.,[]
I enjoyed reading on it everyday until I returned it.,[]
It was light and extremely easy to navigate with its touch screen.,[]
"What happened though, was on about the 12th day while using it the touch screen stopped responding.",[]
I couldn't turn a page with the screen or pull up a menu with the screen or do anything else.,[]
"And, when I shut it off and turned it back on I couldn't swipe the screen to get into the book - I was completely stuck...locked out.",[]
Finally after fiddling with it after about 15 minutes it started to work again.,[]
I went on the web and found out that others had this same thing happen to them so I decided to return it rather then hope for a fix (I was still within my 14 days return policy).,[]
The pages turn slowly on this nook.,[]
I was unable to download a library book on it.,[]
A microsoft person tried for some time to download a library book without success.,[]
"I believe that this was not a new nook as advertised, but a used faulty nook.",[]
I returned it and was given a refund.,[]
I bought a new nook glowlight from Barnes and Noble and it works very well.,[]
"NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT I WANTED, I THINK THE KINDLE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO LIKE AND  USE.",[]
"very very good value for this reader, and I am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away.",[]
They immediately sent a replacement.,[]
Immediately.,[]
I didnt buy it on amazon because it was WAY TO EXPENSIVE but I got mine for 140$ at Best Buy or you can get it at Barns and Noble for the same price.,[]
This WAS MY FIRST eREADER AND I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,[]
It has LONG BATTERY LIFE UP TO 1 MONTH ON A SINGLE CHARGE AND IT IS THE LIGHTEST eREADER ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,[]
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOOK NO FURTHER FOR YOUR eREADER!!,[]
!,[]
"This is my first reader and after a month of using it, I'm still very happy with it.",[]
"It's easy to use, easy (for the eyes) to read, and has a very reliable battery-life.",[]
It's also light and offers a good hand grip with its rubber back cover.,[]
I got it delivered very quickly.,[]
"The only surprise I had, but then it explains why this model is a lot less expensive compared to the others is that this one is the first generation of Nook.",[]
It has only a few hundred Mb of internal memory and does not have back-lid screen to allow you to read  in the dark.,[]
"But, since it has a slot for a 32Gb external microSD, and I don't use it in the dark, it is a perfect quality-priced for me.",[]
first time I use e ink book.I did not know what to look for in the nook.I love the basic idea of it but I i wish I got the one with light function.,[]
It has a great quality and it's better than I expected.,[]
P e r f e c t !,[]
!,[]
!,[]
However says that the Nook is the cheapest tablet out thier and the best well you are wrong  .,[]
It is not a good tablet .,[]
In fact I have used one and hate it .,[]
Hate it .,[]
And if you are an expert on tablets like me well you cant even call it that .,[]
"How can call this a tablet when it is only made of rubber , wire and a screen .",[]
"Another thing that makes a tablet goood is ( please not im doing this from a Kindle Fire point of a view ) that you can have apps , books , music and videos .",[]
Does the Nook allow any of this ?,[]
Nope except the book part .,[]
It is also very weak .,[]
You stop using it and you must charge it .,[]
I hope my review keeps everybody away from this tablet ( opps ).,[]
Once again Barnes and Nobles fails to compete .,[]
The nook e book reader has been a good buy for my wife.,[]
It was a bit difficult to learn how to download ebooks from our local library but once we got the hang of it she has really enjoyed it.,[]
I have long loved ereaders.,[]
I had the original Nook and used it until they cam out with this model.,[]
I have had it for a year now and love it.,[]
I bought two more for my parents which is why I am doing this review.,[]
"Pros:Battery life did seem to be good.Connected to wifi without an issue.Cons:Difficult/sticky page turn buttons (easily my largest complaint).Annoying interface.Ghosting of screen.Lack of ability to browse web, check email, etc.Disappointed even after rooting (i.e., making Android features accessible).Lack of ease of directly importing without a computer or FINDING free classics.No ability to go landscape mode.This seemed like a great idea that was poorly executed.",[]
The page turn buttons were terrible.,[]
My thumbs were getting sore waaaay too quickly when these buttons were supposedly designed for this use.,[]
"I probably could have put up with everything else, but that was too big of an issue to me.The built-in interface was annoying and simplistic, but not the end of the world.",[]
You had advertisements for books you don't care about and you can't get rid of their default books.,[]
And there was no way to easily browse something like Project Gutenberg to get free books.,[]
"The ghosting was annoying at times, but wasn't egregious.",[]
But I did notice it.,[]
"The main thing it did was make the text the slightest bit blurry at times (i.e., not crisp).",[]
Made me feel like I needed my glasses (which I don't need for reading).I was shocked that there was no browser or email client.,[]
"I'm not expecting an iPad, but the Kindle lets you at least browse the web.",[]
"Yes, you could access a browser sort of, but it would randomly kick you out of wherever you were at and send you back to the search feature.For those looking to root it:It wasn't terribly difficult to root, but for me it really wasn't worth it.",[]
Things just don't work that well.,[]
"You can probably make things work, but for me, it would have required a significantly higher time investment to get things acceptable than I was willing to give it.",[]
"For instance: Text on web sites was often not sharp and difficult to read, images looked bad, and the inability (that I could find) to remap the primary buttons to quit going back to the stupid B&N; interface made it difficult to navigate.",[]
"Additionally, ""search"" in the app store didn't work, and on some menus of the the OS the text was not visible at all (you had to guess what the icon was referring to and hope it wasn't anything bad).Over all, it was simply disappointing.",[]
"Perhaps I was expecting too much from a $140 device with ""simple"" in the name.",[]
Oh well.,[]
I ended up returning it to Staples.,[]
222222222222222222fore2222worssssssswrodssopp;doe,[]
"I have owned this, and had to have it replaced during the first year.My wife has one, and it stopped working after the one year warranty expired.",[]
This a second generation e-reader.,[]
"By adding a 16 GB micro SD card, it can store more e-books than I'll ever own.",[]
Most of my books are in PDF format.,[]
It has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an e-book in PDF form that I bought from Forbes.com.,[]
All these books display properly in PDF readers available on personal computers.It's other weakness is that it has minimal documentation.,[]
The topics are covered but the explanaitons leave the user with a lot of questions.,[]
Very light weight and charge lasts a long time.,[]
Paper like screen easy on the eyes.,[]
Great for just reading.,[]
I love to read.,[]
"This is perfect, i don't have to wait for a book to be released in the stores to read it.",[]
This is an excellent product and the price is right!,[]
"I have purchased one of these for my grandson, my grand daughter, my daughter and my best friend and now this one is for ME!",[]
When I saw the price of this nook I thought it was time I treat myself and I absolutely love it!,[]
"My grandson shows me how to load my books and it is so much easier for me to hold this and read than it is to &#34;flip pages&#34; I can also carry this in my pocketbook with ease without it taking up space, what a great invention.",[]
Little did I realize what a great gift I was giving until I got my own and I am saving tons of money not buying books!,[]
"You can even set your font to the size you want so you don't have to squint to read, this is really a fantastic gadget!",[]
Recipient love the Nook!,[]
"I really liked the way the pages look on the Nook, VERY much like that of a paper book!",[]
I have ordered my Nook from Amazon.,[]
First problem was the charging.,[]
Manuals told me to charge it for three and a half hours maximum.,[]
I could not use it for more then two days while it was charging continuously(!),[]
"from my computer.It was annoying.In the first two weeks I could not read anything, because of the lack of the wifi access.It is funny in case of an ebook reader.Then I had to add my email address and a valid bank account and other identifications.",[]
"They needed too many personal data, before using the tool.It is also funny in case of an ebook reader.The PDF files that I copied to Nook  were not readable.",[]
"I could recognise the titles only.That was the third funny experiance.Then after two weeks, while I left the Nook alone, I noticed that I have a new ebook and I could open the files, that I could not before.Next funny thing.",[]
"After using it normally for a few weeks, once tapping did not work.",[]
I charged it and it worked again.,[]
"I thought that tapping does not work well, when the battery is flat.Funny, but acceptable.It used it for a few hours, and had the same problem at tapping.",[]
"I even could not reach my files, because tapping needs for 'opening' the tools.",[]
No other way.,[]
"If tapping does not work, you can not reach your ebooks, however there are some phisical buttom on the tool, also.Funny and annoying.Now the situation is : sometimes it does sense the tapping, sometimes doesn't.Final annoying concern: spam mail per almost every day, about how to spend your money on ebooks and related things.Favourites beyond all negatives:Nice , Light, Quick, Handle all kind of characters and signs (not just letters, but mathematical formulas also, and not just English letters, but other ones, also), Size of the letters can adjustable.","[('letters', 0.05857803502540873)]"
Tapping - when works - can take paging very very easy.,[]
"I got this as a Christmas present from my parents and when I opened the packaging, my expectations were high.It is light, which is nice when you're laying down and reading or is just nice when carrying it in your bag.Though, the whole flashes-when-you-turn-the-page thing is a bit annoying at first, you get used to it.",[]
"The store, starting up and loading books and everything else is pretty fast and reliable.The option to either tap the page, use the buttons located on either sides or slide the page are all nice to be able to choose and the page isn't overly touchy or anything.The only thing I had a HUGE problem with - and maybe it's just mine, but - there is a problem when connecting to certain wifi connections and I've read about other people having the same problem.","[('page', 0.15089447973394007)]"
I don't know how to fix it and Customer Service has been little help.,[]
"So that is really the only problem I have with this.Other than that, if you just want something simple --like the products suggest - you will love this little device.",[]
"Plus, it's very affordable and made well!",[]
:),[]
I ordered the Nook Simple Touch online and was happy when it arrived quicker than expected.,[]
I quickly tore into the packaging like a ten year old at Christmas and plugged the device into my computer.,[]
"I then attempted to closely follow the ""quick start"" instruction, but accidentally brushed through step 7 more quickly than I could read step 2...  Super easy set up!",[]
I did run into one little hiccup when the screen when completely blank for a while and I thought I had prematurely ended it's existence...,[]
"Turns out it just didn't want to display anything while it had a discussion with the internet and I've come to expect this occasionally when accessing the internet, but it is usually very quick and never affects my reading.Next, it was time to download my first book.",[]
"I already had a book in mind so I went to the ""shop"" icon and typed the book's name into the search bar.",[]
The book I was searching for appeared instantly atop of several other ridiculous options.,[]
I selected the book and in a couple touches it was downloading.,[]
"It downloaded quickly, but when I went to open the book I ran into some trouble.",[]
The Nook was asking for confirmation via my credit card number!,[]
"OK, so I put the card number in.",[]
"Rejected, try again (or something to that effect).",[]
"After about ten tries, I calmly put the Nook down and asked Google for help.",[]
I was directed to a help forum where many people were having this problem and there were plenty of possible solutions.,[]
I tried some of them and after about half an hour I was finally able to open my book.,[]
"I still have no idea what caused this problem or what I did to fix it if anything, but I haven't had this particular problem since.The reading experience was everything I had hoped it would be!",[]
The letters stood out even more clearly than in most printed books and I was easily able to increase the text size just a touch to fit my preferred reading distance.,[]
I have no trouble reading for extended periods of time as I have had with backlit e-readers which hurt my eyes after a while.,[]
The options to change the font and size make it easy to find my spot quickly if I get distracted.After a couple of days I decided I wanted a break from my very long book and thought I'd try a magazine or newspaper.,[]
I had trouble finding one that I really wanted to read.,[]
The selection seems awfully short and does not seem to match up to the selection the website provides.,[]
There is a nifty little 14 day free trial that I like a lot.,[]
I chose a magazine that I had never heard of but sounded interesting.,[]
It turned out to be Socialist-Extremist psycho babble.,[]
After reading several articles I got to my Mac and cancelled my subscription.,[]
"I do not hold B&N; accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.",[]
I have determined that they do not do a very good job of making recommendations.,[]
"Also, if you want to read more about the publication or customer reviews, you must go online to do it - it can not be done from the Nook.",[]
After canceling my subscription I decided to read the reviews of that magazine and would never have chosen it had I read them first.,[]
"Thank goodness for that 14 day free trial!I also decided to subscribe to another magazine that I found in the ""My Nook"" online account that I could not find in through actual Nook.",[]
"That subscription is showing up in my online library, but not on the Nook itself.",[]
"After another half hour of research, it appears that the Nook accounts do not sync very well and tons of people are having this problem.",[]
"Learning point: never order something online in the ""My Nook - My Library"" and expect to actually read it.I also do not like the way that newspapers and magazines are presented.",[]
It's very confusing how you have to go through the introduction to several articles before you can actually read any article.,[]
"I realize that this is much like seeing the cover of an actual printed publication, but I am not forced to read every intro before opening the cover of a magazine and when it changes sections it is easy to not realize that you are now back to a cover section and think you are going to get the entire article only to be cut off when you turn the page.",[]
"I have gotten used to this, but I still don't like it.",[]
I also do not believe that this is Nook specific.,[]
"This appears to be the format for all e-readers, although I haven't tried it on all of them.Regardless of my complaints, I am actually very happy with the Nook Simple Touch itself.",[]
The process at Barnsandnoble.com needs some massive improvement and I could not review the Nook without addressing these concerns.,[]
Ordered this product for a family memeber .,[]
Excellent service from Barnes and Noble on set up and operation.,[]
I would highly reocommend this product for anyone who likes to read,[]
I am happy with this eReader from Nook but I would advise to buy the one with GlowLight so that you can read at any time.,[]
Don't buy if you wanna read at bedtime with all the lights turned off.,[]
"Overall its good, portable, well-built and cheaper than kindle.",[]
"Very disappointed in purchasing 2 of these, one for my wife and one for myself.",[]
We learned a couple months after purchasing different books on both devices that we could only loan the book out to the other device one time only for a 14 day period.,[]
Both of us typically read over lunch breaks and it takes longer than that to finish a book.,[]
Yes I do realize that we can just trade nooks back and forth though for the price of a ebook and the actual book I would rather purchase a hard copy of the book.,[]
Wife bought this for her elderly mother - but she couldn't quite get the hang of using it (tech challenged)... My wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well... All is good :),[]
"I bought two Nooks, one for me and the other for my wife.",[]
"One of them started to have problems as from day 2, the battery ran-out too quickly and had to recharge it permanently.",[]
I contacted Barnes & Noble to have it replaced and each time a different representative asked me the same questions over and over and gave me different -contradictory- directions to proceed for replacement.,[]
"Of course it wasn't replaced, it was a complete deception.",[]
"The product does not work as advertised, if you ever have a problem Barnes & Noble won't even bother to help and they will make their best for you to lose your patience and leave it as trash at home.",[]
I thank Barnes & Noble for a terrible shopping experience and the worst product offer.,[]
"Well, I would love to put pros and cons but I cannot gain access into my nook because of my number 1 con.",[]
"I understand it is a ""Wifi"" device but I just figured it meant it is wifi not 3G.",[]
Not that you have to register it before you can do anything with it.,[]
"I am deployed and have no access to wireless connections where I am at so I am not able to register it to use it.So until I return home, it will just sit without a purpose.",[]
"Most of the guys here have Kindles and they love them, I would recommend and wish I did, get a kindle.",[]
Good reader for the price.,[]
"Arrived quickly with no shipping cost, love Amazon.com!",[]
"My daughter ordered this and loves it, easy for a 12 year old to use.",[]
First let me say this nook is lightweight and simple and good for anyone who simply loves to read and wants to bring their library with them.,[]
There is no backlight which greatly reduces eye strain compared with other ereaders.,[]
The interface is laid out in easy to use functions and the pages actually look like those of a real book.,[]
"Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.",[]
All purchase books are your forever compared to other ebook services who may take the boom away when the publisher ends digital publishing.,[]
"If you're looking for something simple without bells and whistles and are a true book lover, you will love this nook.",[]
Great for any age too!,[]
(Font sizes are adjustable.,[]
Yay!),[]
"How do I hate thee, let me count some of the ways:1.",[]
You need to create a B&N; account to get normal use of it.,[]
(If you bypass registration it sucks up power like a Hoover!,[]
Charge doesn't last very long as it goes through B&N; registration cycle in the background regardless if wi-fi is on or off.)2.,[]
You MUST tie a credit card to your B&N; account or you can't buy anything including FREE books!3.,[]
"If you decide to ""manually"" load books via USB, realize you have only 250mb of space for this purpose!",[]
(The advertised 2GB IS DECEPTIVE.,[]
"The bulk of the ""space"" is reserved for ""B&N; content"" and purchases that you make only from B&N.;)4.",[]
No PASSWORD PROTECTION OPTION to secure your device.,[]
Lose your nook and the thief can buy up stuff at B&N; on your dime.5.,[]
No text to speech options.6.,[]
"No audio files allowed (mp3, etc.)7.",[]
"Wi-Fi only, no independent 3g/Internet access.8.",[]
"Slow response and ""typing"" is cumbersome with virtual keyboard.9.",[]
You CAN'T read any books you've purchased elsewhere unless they are open format and again good luck with that whopping 250mb of space!10.,[]
"Once you create a B&N; account, it is a pain in the butt to try to delete it.",[]
You have to call and beg them to lose your information and delete the account.,[]
"You CAN'T do it yourself, it isn't even an option.================The ONLY pluses:The device has an SD card slot to load books in epub or pdf format (but even this is tedious and fraught with problems.",[]
)It's small (but cases are cheap quality AND overpriced).,[]
This is the third ebook reader I've used and definitely the best.,[]
The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.,[]
"The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).",[]
"Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.","[('n', 0.07724687716933615)]"
That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.,[]
I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.,[]
"The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.",[]
Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.,[]
"The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.",[]
"You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.",[]
"You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).",[]
"The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.","[('n', 0.139122832232332)]"
"Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""",[]
"To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.",[]
"And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.","[('nook', 0.1)]"
But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!,[]
)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.,[]
"At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).","[('title', 0.12216516403764066)]"
"That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.",[]
"So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!",[]
"My best friend loved the surprise gift I got her, she takes it every where she goes.",[]
"Small and light, very convenient.",[]
"Gave this to my granddaughter, who loves it.",[]
She uses it all the time and loves the touch feature and ease of downloading.,[]
I really like the Nook Simple Touch and the way it displays e-books.,[]
The problem for me has been fairly consistent problems with functionality.,[]
The firmware on the device as delivered didn't work at all.,[]
It was appalling that a brand new factory version's touch screen did not accurately respond to where I touched.,[]
It took days of trying to connect to wi-fi because of this.,[]
"I immediately installed the firmware update, and that seemed to work.",[]
"But it still gets unresponsive often, reverts back to the homescreen or settings panel in the middle of reading.Thus, this device, which is not accepted for return by the seller I bought it from, is infuriating and largely unused.",[]
"I keep looking for a new firmware update to finally solve this issue, but I doubt B&N; will have any forthcoming.Update: I think the problem I described above is a flaw with my own device and not about firmware.",[]
I have since purchased a Kindle and I couldn't be happier with it.,[]
Is great for reading and fairly simple to use.,[]
"Now reading a lot more, since I bought my new Nook eBook Reader.",[]
I received this as a christmas present.,[]
"I will admit that when opening I was somewhat disappointed with the ereader I got (yes, I did want an ereader though).",[]
"Because I had actually asked for the kindle touch, but I soon became happy with the NST.",[]
"Here is my thought process...*Even though the Kindle has text to speech (and not NST), people online pointed out that it seemed very robotic, which would make me not want to use that feature.",[]
"*The Kindle DOES have audiobooks (unlike the NST) but most audio books are about 30 hours, and I would rather read than sit for that time.",[]
"*The Kindle also has a web browser, but an e-ink display is not really ment for internet use, making it slow and laggy.",[]
Thus it is not really a advantage.,[]
"*Barnes & Noble actually has stores to go and ask questions*On the nook, you can change the wallpaper/screensaver.",[]
"*You can do that ^ on the kindle but you have to hack it first.Although I do think that the Kindle IS a better device, it a lot more expensive if you want no ads.",[]
I just would like you to remember that this is my thought process and everyone has their own opinion.,[]
I HAVE been using the nook a lot and I think it is a great device to.ONE FINAL THING: I have noticed that I have only used my nook for a week and it is already low on battery (the battery life is supposed to be 2 months).,[]
Given...,[]
I have used it nonstop so I can understand why.,[]
"That is why I gave 5, not 4...  just wanted to point that out.",[]
I wanted to buy an e-book and decided on a nook.,[]
Broke in 3 months.,[]
NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.,[]
I tried to get support and the company refused to help me.,[]
"Evidentally, there are screen problems with the Nooks.",[]
I did research and alot of other people had that same problem.,[]
Getting support for it is even worse.,[]
Don't bother with it.,[]
Go with a Kindle or a Sony.,[]
I had to give a gift to a family friend of mine who has very badly deformed hands (due to arthritis and surgeries) which makes holding a book hard for her.,[]
"I knew she was an avid reader when she had better hands.Instead of following suite with getting scarves, blankets, and stuff she may have filled a closet with, I looked into an e-reader.This was simple to use, she can tap to flick to the next page, easy to hold, and the price was right.",[]
I pre-loaded it with books of genres she loved and an AC wall charger.,[]
She was so overwelmed to have it and has been enjoying it.My grandfather leaned over Christmas morning after she opened it and said to me &#34;She never gets anything special these days.,[]
I've never seen her any happier to be able to read again.,[]
I think you have gotten the most thoughtful gift ever today.&#34;,[]
The Nook Simple Touch is a wonderfully engineered e-reader.,[]
I got mine for X-mas and have read a 300 plus page book on it.,[]
The screen is very easy on the eyes.,[]
You can read for as long as you like.,[]
The e-ink print is sharp.,[]
The tablet is easy to hold.,[]
"You can turn a page with just a tap of your finger on the screen, or press a side bar.",[]
Pages turn instantly.,[]
"I have wifi, and buying a new book and downloading it is easy.",[]
Download time is a matter of seconds.,[]
I am using this to read popular fiction and non-fiction.,[]
"I don't need a tablet, and my shelf space is limited.",[]
Now I don't have to get rid of an old book to shelve a new book.,[]
I am a happy (Nook) camper!,[]
Purchased the NOOK Touch e-reader for my daughter for Christmas.,[]
We were not too happy with it so for a few dollars more she upgraded to the NOOK notebook.,[]
There are many more options offered...although I wasn't aware that a lot of the apps are not free ones.,[]
"For the money, though, it is a better buy.",[]
She loves it.,[]
"Also, Barnes and Noble is wonderful at Tech Support.",[]
They helped her get it all set up!,[]
"Been waiting to pick one of these up, but pay attention to the price on amazon.",[]
"Last night it was listed at the regular retail price of $139.95, but this morning the price magically jumped to $166.43???",[]
"Can't go wrong w/ this ereader - much better, lighter, faster than the kindle, just watch the price if purchasing on amazon.",[]
Do not purchase if the price is more than $140.,[]
bought this for my 9 year pld grand -daughter .,[]
for us ein school and at home she is a avide eader and she loves it,[]
"The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!",[]
)-install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too-Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard-Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N; reader and the rest of the device's functionality.I used these instructions:[Amazon removed my link.,"[('amazon', 0.0827748537602753)]"
"Google ""Root Nook Touch Using TouchNooter & Install Go Launcher, NookColor Tools, Gmail, Market & YouTube"", it's the top link.",[]
"]I will be buying LOTS of these as gifts, and I'm going to root them all!",[]
This is a perfect device for hackers and regular ebook readers too!What's a Kindle?,[]
Never heard of it.,[]
"I bought the NOOK for my wife for Christmas, she has not put it down since she got it.",[]
The only thing wrong is I thought I was getting the one with the glow lite and I didn't.,[]
Just received my eBook Reader and am very pleased with it.,[]
"Only problem, the usb cable doesn't seem to keep a firm connection to the devise and it took longer than usual for the book to charge.",[]
I finally used the usb cable that came with my first Nook and it charged in no time.The pages turn fast as advertised and the screen is very easy to read.,[]
Can't say anything negative except for the cable and would recommend The Simple Touch eBook Reader.,[]
My wife loves her Nook.,[]
It has her back to reading.,[]
She downloads books from the library with ease.,[]
She especially likes the fact it brings her back to the same spot she stopped.,[]
Great device.,[]
Bought it for my niece.,[]
She loves it.,[]
Easy to use.,[]
Downloaded books.,[]
It is keeping her busy.,[]
It's a good reader.,[]
I own both original Nook and this.,[]
"I use this only for reading books (no annotation, markup, Web browsing, etc.",[]
").Good: lightweight, long battery life, good contrast, quick display refresh.Bad: hardware buttons, accidental page turns, must have B&N; account.Good hardware buttons are a MUST, and the original Nook's win.","[('lightweight', 0.08916266806165124)]"
"These buttons require more force, and that's if you press the center of the button.",[]
Good luck if you press either the top or the bottom portion of the button.,[]
"In short, feeling the ridge beneath your thumb and pressing doesn't mean the page will turn.I often accidentally tap the screen slightly while reading, and it causes a page turn.",[]
There is no option to disable the touch screen while reading.I was required to connect the Nook to a B&N; account on setup.,[]
I get my books elsewhere and don't have a desire to hook up with B&N; online right now.,[]
"Blah.Overall, improved over original Nook in many ways.",[]
Very quick.,[]
Touch screen can be nice.,[]
Disappointed with the hardware buttons.,[]
"The screen is good, overall it's not a bad ereader.",[]
3 quick issues.,[]
"First, the sticky rubber on the back is already peeling.",[]
"Second, you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi, and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.",[]
"Third, and worst of all, is you cannot sync books that are not purchased through nook to your phone.",[]
This is really aggravating.,[]
I don't read a ton so I didn't want to pay a huge premium for an e-reader.,[]
"I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.",[]
"It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.",[]
"When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.",[]
I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.,[]
I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.,[]
I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.,[]
I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.,[]
"From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.","[('ade', 0.08916266806165123)]"
It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.,[]
Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.,[]
The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.,[]
Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.,[]
"I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.",[]
"From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.",[]
"I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.",[]
"If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.",[]
"The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)",[]
"All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.",[]
"But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...",[]
The ebook costs more than a physical copy.,[]
It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!,[]
Give me a break!),[]
"So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.",[]
"You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.",[]
"You type in the name of a book into google and add ""epub download"" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)",[]
"Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.The main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.",[]
I love the shape and feel over the kindle.,[]
"But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N;, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)",[]
"I dont know why I bought this tablet, just only one day using it and I stored it in a place where it continues stored...",[]
"I dont like the screen... it reflects light from many sources (sun, bulbs, etc) despite the type of technology used in the screen...the size is no convenient, I think a bigger one good be better... well, this is my opinion about this product...","[('screen', 0.12431294196997547)]"
"What I like about Nook (so far):-easy to use-has a memory card slot for more storage capacity-light and convenient to carry around-very good for a basic readerWhat I don't like:-sometimes the display appears fadedAll in all, I'm liking my new Nook.",[]
"I only got this unit 2 weeks ago, though.",[]
i love it but i can not figure out how to delete books after I read them.,[]
i guess i need to get back in the manual but it is very long and hard to get through,[]
The nook was fine.,[]
"I bought it as a present and when the recipient used it, she realized she would rather have the one that lights up.",[]
I asked to exchange it for store credit and buy the more expensive one but they wouldn't.,[]
I guess if you want real customer service you have to go to a real store.,[]
I have to caveat my review and say that I have the version from two years ago--not this newest version.,[]
"But I had to submit a review even though I couldn't find that version, because I love my Nook so much!I never wanted an e-reader--I was one of those ""I like REAL books"" people.",[]
But I received it as a gift before a European vacation and man I was instantly sold.,[]
I've had it over two years and never had a problem.,[]
The touch screen is a bit slow (as compared to my Android smartphone) but I wasn't expecting it to be like that--it serves the purpose it was intended to.,[]
And I like that it's JUST an e-reader.,[]
"The e-Ink display doesn't hurt my eyes and it's the perfect size to hold in both hands, or just one (like a medium-sized paperback).",[]
It's also SO THIN!,[]
"I was in the middle of reading the Game of Thrones series and man alive, those books are huge!",[]
So glad I had my Nook to read them on instead :).,[]
I LOVE MY NOOK!,[]
BEST PRESENT EVER!,[]
It's exactly what I wanted.,[]
"It's comfortable, reliable, convenient and easy to read.",[]
I don't think I will be buying any other readers in the future.,[]
This one is perfect for my needs.,[]
"Bought this for my 92 year old mother, & I wasn't sure if she could manage a &#34;electronic&#34; reader, but she loves it!",[]
"It is easy for her to operate & lightweight for her to hold for a long time, since she reads all day.",[]
"First of all, I tried posting this review on bn.com, but they won't post because of inappropriate language!?!",[]
(Or is it because I gave a bad review?,[]
")I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision.",[]
"My complains are:- I experienced two major technical problems within 5 months of purchase.- Technical support was clueless as to how to fix them, and instead suggested resetting and/or replacing the entire unit.- The replacement experience has taken over two months and 3 lengthy phone calls to customer service, and yet I still don't have a replacement.When I was shopping for an e-reader this past summer, I originally was going to go with a Kindle since they have a better selection of cheap and/or free e-books, but at that time, only the Nook had Touch capabilities, which ultimately won me over.Everything was going great until the button for Settings no longer responded, which meant I could no longer turn on the wireless to download any other books.",[]
"Technical Service had no idea how to fix it, so they walked me through resetting the entire device, deleting everything I already had on it.",[]
Then they suggested updating my software version to avoid problems in the future.,[]
"Unfortunately, this completely crashed the Nook to the point that even the most drastic steps to do a full reset didn't work.",[]
They said that since it was under warranty they would ship me a replacement.It never came.,[]
I called back every 2-3 weeks for the past two months asking for an update.,[]
"I got excuses like: they warehouse is busy, and you have to send yours back first (even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back).At this point, I don't even want it anymore.",[]
"And even though the user manual says that you can get your money back if your device is found to be defective, I have been informed that this only happens if you return it during the first 14 days of ownership.",[]
"Going as high up on the customer service ladder as possible, all they said is that I cannot get a refund, and a replacement should be coming 'soon.",[]
"'When and if it comes, I probably won't open it.",[]
I don't want to be reminded of this experience every time I pick it up.,[]
"I'm going to cut my losses, and go get myself a Kindle.",[]
I have dealt with Amazon customer service in the past and have extremely satisfied with them.,[]
Lesson learned.,[]
I tried several times to set up my account but kept getting an error.,[]
I finally had to go online to set up my account.,[]
"Also, I don't see how to set parental controls.",[]
"I should have done my homework before purchasing.Also, I don't like how the screen transitions from one screen to the next.",[]
It seems to jump around.,[]
This device does exactly what it is advertised as doing.,[]
"The battery lasts for weeks, the storage is more than enough for a battery's worth of reading material.",[]
"Be sure to keep it clean, or the interface will stop functioning.",[]
So I purchased this item after my last ebook reader (Amazon with keyboard)broke in my bag.,[]
So I was between this and the amazon touch and the only thing that swayed me to buy the nook was that I could find for cheaper online.,[]
and I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase.,[]
"It is an excellent Ebook reader, I like the fact that it gives real page numbers (though at this point I am sure amazon's does as well).",[]
But I also liked the fact that there are physical buttons in conjunction with a touch screen.,[]
"Overall, my reading experience with his device and Amazon is pretty much the same.",[]
The two BIG differences is that the ebook store on amazon is WAY better than the ebook store on B&N; (which is a big deal to me) and I like the fact that I can search content on WIFI with the Amazon reader (such as wikipedia).,[]
"But in terms of purely reading, there is no difference to me between the two.But when an Amazon ebook reader with a light comes out I am jumping back on the amazon ship....",[]
"Before I purchased my eReader, I did a ton of research and, for a time, I actually ended up owning both devices - the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Touch with 3G.",[]
"Here is my comparison.There are many things that I prefer on the Nook over the Kindle.- Nook has page scroll buttons so that I don't have to touch (and smudge-up) the screen each time I turn the page- Though both eReaders advertise a battery life of two months, Kindle's is based on 30 minutes of use per day; the Nook's is based on 1-hour of use.","[('nook', 0.12960211945208475)]"
"In other words, the Nook's battery life lasts TWICE AS LONG.- The layout of the device software on the Nook is more user-friendly with the Nook.",[]
"For example, the Nook has a home-page and a very simple menu to orient yourself between different screens.",[]
"Using the Kindle, on the other hand, I always felt slightly disoriented, though I am sure many Kindle-users would tell you otherwise.There are also several things I preferred on the Kindle over the Nook.- The casing of the Kindle is better and has a better feel.",[]
This was not a big deal for me because I have a skin for my Nook - one of the colored ones BN sells.- The Kindle Touch can come with 3G.,[]
"There are two reasons I am really happy using a Nook, even though it doesn't have 3G.",[]
(1) I have wireless internet at my house.,[]
"(2) Even if I didn't, I could still buy books for the Google eBookstore at Google Play using a computer with an internet conection.Other things to consider:- Will you be reading books or daily publications more?",[]
A daily publication requires a constant source to internet.,[]
"A 3G network might be really important if you want the daily newspaper.- With the Nook, you are able to read books or documents in the epub or pdf format.",[]
"This means that you can purchase books from BN, google, and many other internet bookstores (ie.",[]
More competition).,[]
"With the Kindle, you will, almost definitely, only be purchasing products from Amazon.",[]
BN (Nook) book prices tend to be higher than Amazon (Kindle).,[]
"Amazon (Kindle) book prices about the same as Google (Nook).In the end, I felt that the Nook Simple Touch was a better purchase and a better device that was more intuitive to use and had to be charged much less frequently.",[]
I returned the Kindle.,[]
"The NOOK e-book reader compares favourably with the KINDLE, as well as being cheaper.",[]
Once you have mastered the idiosyncratic technique for converting books to EPUB format and loading them onto the NOOK - I suggest getting a copy of CALIBRE which will streamline the conversion process.,[]
The NOOK is lighter and more convenient to carry around than the KINDLE - my wife crocheted a nice neat carry bag for mine.,[]
I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques (maybe I should read the instructions) but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.,[]
TO sum up - I am very satisfied.Kiap2012,[]
I was impressed with the ease of set up for this product.,[]
I like the fact that I could do the complete registration right on the device and did not need to complete separate phone call/computer steps.,[]
I basically had my device up and running within minutes of charging.,[]
Its perfect travel size.,[]
Easy downloads.,[]
I just love it !,[]
Came in pretty fast and even though the case had some wear it was amazing.,[]
Thanks !,[]
This is my 1st reader so I can't compare.,[]
I like the sharpness of the letters.,[]
It makes for easy reading.,[]
In conjunction with calibre this is really easy to use.,[]
DO NOT buy this product!!!,[]
I have purchased a nook simple touch and it is awful!!!,[]
The reason is there is not a brightness setting.,[]
On a scale of brightness 1 meaning pitch black and 10 meaning very bright it would be a 3 meaning dull.,[]
This means people that has bad eye sight or has seeing trouble will have a hard time seeing the screen.,[]
With light the screen is dull and without light the screen is pitch black!,[]
They make attachable lights for them but what is the point!!!,[]
You should just buy the newer ones.,[]
Now I am stuck with this nook that is useless.,[]
"I have gone thru a lot of reviews of this eBook before ordering it, mainly due to its long battery life.Within a week, it got shipped home (excellent seller).However, the product itself is far from being a good eBook Reader.I have had two: one Kindle eBook reader (with keyboard) and one 10.2"" Android tablet that I used as a reader mainly.The Nook is cumbersome:THE BADS:1) the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement, then click ACCEPT !!!",[]
(like I am installing a new software !!!,[]
")2) the second thing is to setup for a WIFI access, I have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day.",[]
"Can't do anything until WIFI access is established.THE GOODS3) I went to a local B&N; store to get instant WIFI access which I did,THE BAD4) then create an account, enter my credit card number (why do I need to do this at this time).",[]
Should only ask when I first order something from B&N.,[]
";THE GOOD:5) now I can copy my eBook in PDF formats to it, this part is straightforward.THE BAD:6) I opened one of my PDF doc and it came up with a huge font size7) try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size, the menu appears, then quickly disappears.",[]
"I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size.",[]
The text now reads fine.,[]
"But the ""next page"" , ""previous page"" buttons are too hard to push, it takes a hard push to get it to work.9) I close the document and try to open another one, it won't open10) try to re-open the first one, not open eitherFrom this point on, it simply refused to open any document I have on it.11) I even convert one PDF to epub format (specifically target the Nook)  and load on it, does not open either.","[('document', 0.1526001984884677)]"
And the epub size is much larger than PDF size (i.e.,[]
"I will have a lot less books on it).To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today.And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for ""firwmare operated"" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these ""Software/firmware"" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good.I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.My older two eBook readers work right of the box.","[('gadgets', 0.05266100519531482)]"
"Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!!",[]
I don't buy something to read these ads.,[]
"Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing).",[]
"Rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work.Many users were lucky to get the ones that work (touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here), I was not and don't want to try my luck with it again.",[]
"Cool e-ink reader!Rooted it in the first day of usage, still can't get noRefresh and multi-touch, but working on it.Very responsive touch screen for this type of screen.",[]
I loved this e-reader for a long time.,[]
"It was just what I wanted, without all of the extra apps and everything else that distracts you from reading.",[]
I also owned a Nook Color (sold) but loved the Simple Touch and used it often because of the e-ink display.,[]
"I could read for hours without hurting my eyes even in sunlight, something I couldn&#8217;t do on the Color or on a computer.",[]
"The battery life is still excellent 3 years later, it really will last 2 months without a charge.",[]
"Plus, B&N sold the cutest cases for it.",[]
I stopped using my Nook Simple Touch (trying to sell it) because I no longer purchase books from the B&N store.,[]
Kindle books are often a little cheaper and the customer service is A LOT better!,[]
I emailed B&N a few times and never received a reply within the promised 48 hours so I ended up calling.,[]
They will never refund a purchase after it has been downloaded.,[]
I purchased the wrong book and B&N would not even give me store credit so that I could purchase the correct one.,[]
This was within 24 hours of making the purchase and I had never made the mistake before.,[]
I received my first nook almost a year ago.,[]
Right out of the box the power button jiggled back and forth and it very rarely turned on and off for me via the button.,[]
Then 2 months in my Nook stopped responding to me.,[]
"It was just frozen on the screensaver and no matter whether I plugged it into the computer or the wall, it didn't respond.",[]
I called the company and was told to bring it into my nearest story (which is about an hour and half away).,[]
She got it to charge and boot up for me saying that the battery was dead even though I had fully charged it the previous day.,[]
FFWD 9 months and my nook still kept freezing.,[]
"It would freeze while reading a book, or browsing the B&N; store or wouldn't load up from the screen saver.",[]
The only way to reboot it was to plug it into the wall and it would reboot.,[]
My final straw was when I could no longer unplug my Nook due to it freezing.,[]
"The second I unplugged it, it would freeze on me and I'd have to repeat the process of plugging it in and waiting for it to start up for me.",[]
"I called the company, they arranged for me to pick up a new Nook at the closest store and I drove down to get my new Nook.",[]
"Apparently, as you might have guessed, my Nook had a faulty battery.",[]
There was no hassle returning the Nook and the guy even let me test drive the new one before walking out of the store to make sure I was happy with it.,[]
"The first thing I noticed besides the fact that it didn't immediately freeze up on me was the fact that the power button was secure and didn't jiggle at all.So since I've gone through two separate Nooks, the latest showing minimal signs of problem, I'd say this is a decent product.",[]
Maybe I just happened to get the lemon of the lot?,[]
I still enjoy reading from my nook.,[]
It's a light weight device and small enough that it fits in my purse with ease.,[]
The e-ink screen makes it easier to read for extended periods of time without having to take a break due to a headache.,[]
The long life battery (when not a dud) lasts long enough for my 20 hr flight and a week without needing to be charged or turned off.,[]
"Since I've gotten the replacement Nook a month ago, I've only needed to plug it in once.",[]
"I also like that when I take it outside to read, there is no glare on the screen.",[]
"It really is as if you are reading a book, except less bulky.",[]
"I like being able to highlight and make notes in the book, it makes going back for references much easier.",[]
"With a book, I would take a strip of paper and put it between the two pages, to later go back and reread them to figure out why I put the paper there.",[]
Even though I had a less than ideal experience with being a Nook owner I do enjoy the device.,[]
I always carry my Nook with me everywhere I go.,[]
"I bought three of the Simple Touches for my three kids (ages 7, 8, 9) for Christmas with the express purpose of allowing them to borrow books from the library.",[]
"However, I have several MAJOR personal issues with these Nooks.1.)",[]
"All three of them have been getting the same error message, which Customer service told me requires me to completely erase all the user data and start over again for each one...including redownloading the books.2.)",[]
"None of the library books will download automatically over the wi-fi, like they do on my Kindle.",[]
"There is a multi-step process that requires me to download them onto Adobe, hook up the Nook, and drag each download onto the Nook.3.)",[]
There is no way to delete books on the Nook itself.,[]
You have to plug it into the computer and actually log into the account - then delete it there.,[]
This is EXTREMELY time consuming when you have three kids who want help with this.4.),[]
B&N; puts unasked for samples of books as well as full free books onto their Nooks.,[]
"As a parent, I DO NOT want my child having access to this adult content !!!!!",[]
Customer service states there is no way to put parental controls or any other way to limit this.,[]
This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!,[]
"And again, the only way to get these things off is to hook up to the computer, log in to each kids' individual account and delete it off, because you can't do it directly on the Nook.",[]
"This is a MAJOR pain, considering how often these things are currently showing up on the Nook.",[]
This product is wonderful!,[]
I coundn't ask for something better to read on.,[]
It will be great for a vacation.,[]
"I know that there are reviews that warn against this item, but we have been very pleased with it.",[]
"Haven't run into any complications, but haven't had it that long.",[]
"If all you need is a reader, this is an awesome way to go!",[]
"I bought this Nook Simple Touch on Amazon.com, but when I received it, the WiFi would not connect.",[]
I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town.,[]
"Barnes & Noble Customer Service was NO HELP, telling me that, since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from B&N;, they could not help me, and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller.",[]
"I did return it, thinking it was damaged somehow, and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument (kudos to him and Amazon!",[]
").Later, I bought one from B&N;, and it had the same problem.",[]
"Again, B&N; Customer Service was NO HELP, but did send a replacement.",[]
The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi.,[]
"Now, I'm arguing with B&N; for a full refund.Most of the reviews are glowing.",[]
But what they don't say is that B&N; has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch.,[]
"Even the B&N; Forum has many references to the problem.I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem.",[]
Just beware.CAVEAT EMPTOR!,[]
the nook is very good it just did not come with the charger cord and i was not informed about that.,[]
This is my first e-reader and I love it.,[]
The e ink is very easy on the eyes.,[]
A backlight would be nice.,[]
"Just as I wanted,a reader to read more books on.it is a great way to read books of a different free on line books.",[]
Great product.,[]
Bought for a friend and they absolutely just love it.,[]
They love that you can download library book.,[]
"the best parts: the touch screen, the battery life, the contours (easy to hold), and the fact that it reads epubs and pdfs well.the parts that could be improved: highlighting the text with accuracy is pretty difficult, sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I am used to on other products",[]
I bought the first-gen Nook in January 2011 and was very happy with it.,[]
Then the new Nook Simple Touch came out and I heard about the features and just had to have it.,[]
The long battery life and touch screen are big selling features.,[]
Plus it's so much faster and so much more fun to browse around on.,[]
I've had it for a couple of weeks and am still happy with my choice.,[]
"I love love the touch screen, and it doesn't have the glare that some touch screens have.You won't be sorry with this choice.",[]
As other reviews have noted - Amazon's price is higher than if you buy it at the B&N; store.,[]
"I paid $139 for mine at the B&N; store, plus I got 30 free (pre-chosen) books because of the upgrade special (on an SD card that slides into the nook).",[]
A space saver.,[]
"I have 100's of books and have ran out of space, so this will help me save space and still enjoy my books.",[]
I love it!,[]
Crisp clear page!,[]
I sit outside in my lawn chair in the bright sunlight and read without a problem!,[]
My daughter took it to the beach with her and loves it!,[]
"Smart, sleek and easy-to-read, this Nook is my first E-reader and I am very happy with it.",[]
Easy to use all the controls on it and it features an easy to understand manual so you can access all of the reader's many features.,[]
"Good price, too.",[]
works excellence  for me would recommend the use of this product more buyers.,[]
fits on product nice and tight and stays on havent had any problem with the product falling off the other pruduct.,[]
"It's best to buy this device directly from Barnes & Noble, either the store or the website.",[]
"I know Amazon won't let me list prices, but at the time I'm writing this the current ""list price"" is 40% higher than the actual in-store price.",[]
"Even with Amazon's current discount, it's higher.",[]
"Buying at the store also gives you the opportunity to purchase the extended warranty, which protects your NOOK from drops and liquid spills, etc, for two years.",[]
"You can take it directly into a store to get it fixed, you don't have to mail it out to Amazon or anything.Otherwise this is a fantastic little e-reader.",[]
The interface is incredibly Simple(ha) and the e-ink is easy to read.,[]
"You can change text size to make any book a large-print book, and buying books through Wi-Fi is a snap.",[]
Barnes & Noble also frequently runs NOOK promotions in the store - just recently there was a coupon for a free box of Godiva Chocolates for NOOK owners.Just sayin'.,[]
:),[]
"This arrived as described, packaged well, and worked well.",[]
The only issue I have ever had with them is its not as user friendly as it could be.,[]
I had to go to online blogs to find the rest of the steps to download an eBook.,[]
Whether it was from Barnes and Noble or the library.,[]
"I previously owned a Kindle and loved it, but it kept breaking.",[]
"I finally gave up in frustration after having it replaced 3 times in the first year.I bought the Nook Simple Touch to replace it, and am very satisfied with my purchase.To be honest, the Kindle is brighter and easier to read in less-than-perfect light.",[]
However the Nook excels in nearly every other way.1) Nook is sturdily reliable.,[]
"I have had no failures with it whatsoever, although I carry it everywhere and use it daily.",[]
"I do have it in a protective case, but I had my Kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway.",[]
POINT:  NOOK.2) Nook Simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent Kindle e-reader.,[]
"Nevertheless, screen-size is ample.3) Nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than Kindle.4) Books download in a blink and are immediately available.",[]
"This too seems faster than with my Kindle.5) There are some things I could do with my Kindle that I can't do with my Nook Simple Touch, but I don't miss those things.",[]
I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.,[]
"POINT: NOOK.Generally, if you are shopping for an inexpensive, simple e-reader, I strongly urge you to buy the Nook, and not the Kindle.",[]
"I have tried both, and prefer the Nook.",[]
"Extremely long battery life, easiness of use, low weight, high build quality, huge book selection, and affordable price make this hands down the best e-reader you can buy for under $100.",[]
Very impressed.,[]
Bought this as a gift for my husband.,[]
He didn't think he would use an e-reader.,[]
The Nook is so easy to set up and use.,[]
I have one too and we both read with them all the time.,[]
"I Love my Nook, the only problem I have been having with it is the turn off button seems to be loose, but over all I am so very happy with it.",[]
it is my first e-reader  ;) thank you...I recommend the Nook Simple Touch to any one who loves to read as I do.,[]
"wether you read a lot or a little, it is just simply the best & so many available books....",[]
This piece of junk takes hours to set up and you really need a laptop also.,[]
After that you can buy books with your credit card if everything works perfect which it never does.,[]
Also you need wi-fi after all that you can read a book.,[]
Save the time and just buy the book or really lose your mind a go to a used book store and buy any book you want for around a dollar and finally don't even consider calling tech support they are useless.,[]
VICKIE IS AN ADVACATE READER AND THIS NOOK TOOK THAT PLA CE OFF ALL THE BOOKS SHE BUYS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE HOUSE.,[]
"COMPACT ENOUGH TO FIT IN HER PURSE, GREAT PRICE AND EVERY BOOK IS IN ONE PLACE.",[]
PRICELESS.,[]
"Have bought it because i read somewhere how to put an unlimited android version on it.I can now read my kindle books, and watch my email when i'm outside without much effort.",[]
It is an excellent e-reader.,[]
"First I was surprised how well you get to see the letters, you actually feel like you're reading on a sheet of paper.",[]
As a second positive point I should say that is extremely lightweight and the battery actually lasts around two months (I turn off the WIFI when I don't need it).,[]
"So far I have not found anything negative, which is excellent.",[]
"In relation to a tablet (I have had the Kindle Fire HD) is much more practical to read and if you do not need apps, browsers or email this is an ideal device.",[]
The Nook Simple Touch is a great little e-reader.,[]
It's easy to use and displays books well.,[]
"It handles pdf files better than my husband's Sony T1 reader, which I have been delighted by as I often get review copies of books in pdf format.The built-in WiFi is only used to access the Nook store and sync your digital library between B&N;'s servers and your reader.The only feature I would like would be a built-in web browser.","[('husband', 0.08277485376027528)]"
It would be nice to be able to get on the local library's digital library with my reader directly instead of having to download the files to my computer first.,[]
It was exchanged for one that worked.Problem with the first one connecting to internet.,[]
Took first one to Barnes & Noble and they worked with my son as it was a gift for him.,[]
Personally I love the Kindle.,[]
"As a librarian, I can not and do not recommend this product to my patrons.",[]
"The product itself is faulty, and the customer service and return policies are very poor.My mother loved her Nook Color so much, she offered to buy me either the Color or the Touch.",[]
"I went with the Touch, thought something simpler would be nice, since I work around computers all day.",[]
I was wrong.,[]
"Within the first 20 days, my Nook started to devour battery power.",[]
"I was told when I bought it I had 30 days to return it for a new one, but apparently, they changed that.",[]
"I was offered a refurbished product to replace a brand new one, which I thought was really cheap of them, and not good customer service.",[]
"Then, I was told it was a software issue, and would be resolved soon, so I held on to my Nook.",[]
"One software update and two other fixes later, and it STILL drains the battery by the minute, lasting only about 8 hours, instead of the promised 2 months.",[]
"I was told to call the warrenty dept, but that was a wasted call - they only repeated what had already been said, and also pointed out I'd now had the unit for 90 days.",[]
"Well, yes I did, but it didn't work MOST of that time, and I only kept it because they kept saying it would be fixed!",[]
"And yes, the wifi was OFF, it's rarely on, actually.",[]
"I have 4 Nooks- I have been using them constantly for the last 2 years (Simple Touch, Color, Classic Nook WiFi).",[]
"Although I rabidly love my Nook Colors, I adore this little Simple Touch.",[]
"It is light, I can read it in many environments, I can carry it in my purse easily, and I don't always need the tablet like functions that I have with my Nook Colors.I have had a wonderful experience with Nooks, and with service and support people in a brick and mortar environment (if there is a problem the store personnel make the call for you-you are not on your own).","[('call', 0.08916266806165123)]"
"I may buy a Kindle some time-if I truly find a reason, but it will be a backup to my Nook library.I know that Amazon is doing this loss leader thing, selling at a loss, trying to convert everyone to Kindles so that you will be married to them forever (now that they finally have something that can compete with the Nook simple touch and Nook color).",[]
But please don't drink the kool aid without thinking about what you really need.,[]
"For me, it is nice walking into a store and sitting in an easy chair, reading books for free on my Nook and communing with other people who are truly book lovers.",[]
I buy that experience when I support a brick and mortar book store.,[]
"My grandaughter loves it, she is 11 and loves to read I believed is the best gift you can give a child.",[]
I bought Nook on yard sell for 35$ in great condition .And only later I found how I was lucky.,[]
I was a devoted reader of real books all my live and never thought that I will love ebook reader.,[]
What I love about Nook that I can change size of letters on ANY e books.,[]
For exemple.,[]
I download e book PD format I made on my computer for free on kindel reader and cant read e book because prints SO small its impossible to read.,[]
On kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on Kindel store.,[]
But not e book you made by yourself.,[]
I could not find Russian e book on Kindle store i would love to read .,[]
So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!,[]
My 11 year-old daughter saved her money for a long time to purchase an eBook reader.,[]
She finally selected a NOOK Touch and purchased the eBook (only) without the extended warranty.,[]
She selected the NOOK because of the plethora of free books offered for this platform and because of the touch screen display.The touch screen shattered after a week of light use.,[]
"Unfortunately, this breakage is not covered under the normal NOOK warranty.",[]
She was devastated.I gave her the now-ancient Kindle 1 that we acquired in 2007.,[]
This Kindle has traveled extensively and seems absolutely bullet-proof.Neither my daughter nor I will purchase another NOOK.,[]
The NOOK Touch is a piece of junk.,[]
It is a birthday gift for my daughter.,[]
"She likes it and thinks that it will be very useful.So,",[]
This is a great and simple eBook reader.,[]
"It's light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading, it's small enough that it's easy to take with me, the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger, and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain.",[]
It does one thing and does it well.,[]
"Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.",[]
"I will start by saying that as far as an ereader goes, the NOok can't really be beat.",[]
You can use this just like a book outside in the sun.,[]
What I don't like about it is not about it as much as purchasing books from Barns and Noble.,[]
Seems like every book I get is list price.,[]
"All I can do is download from B&N too, it's not like I can shop on Amazon which I do a lot.",[]
"so, Nook is great Barnse and nobel is just OK, maybe less than OK in my book (that's a pun!)",[]
Nook Simple Touch is very easy to navigate.,[]
Long battery life.,[]
Also has good online support.,[]
Lightweight and price is very competitive.,[]
This year for Christmas I thought it was important to buy a reader for my grandchildren.,[]
We usually have a smaller limit since we have seven grandchildren.,[]
"Having been a teacher, I know how important reading is so felt this was an important product.",[]
One of the grandsons has physical problem so can't carry heavy books.,[]
this will allow him to download the book and not carry five books weighing over fifty pounds.,[]
Great product for a good price.,[]
"I have had my nook for about 6 months now, and in terms of the product quality, I am fully satisfied.",[]
"The interface doesn't have the ease of use that I was expecting, but I have only ever used apple touchscreen products so I suppose I had set the bar a bit too high.",[]
"The only thing that actually bothers me is the lack of control of the organization of the shelves, but it's not so bad.",[]
"In terms of durability, I was happy to see that the product holds up well, and hasn't broken.",[]
"I also like the way it feels to read on the nook, it doesn't give me a headache and is actually easier than a normal book.",[]
"All of that being said, I haven't used my nook since about three months ago.",[]
"I had begun to read and buy books, and though I enjoyed reading on the nook, I realized that I liked having a physical book, and watching my book collection expand on the shelf.",[]
"With the books I owned on the nook, it hardly even felt like I owned them.",[]
It was just a file.,[]
"Because of this, I haven't bought any more ebooks, and thus haven't really had a reason to use my nook.",[]
"Once my local library has a better selection of ebooks available, I think I would begin to use it more.",[]
"But I would only recommend this product if your library has a good selection of ebooks, or if you don't mind not owning a physical book.",[]
"I heartily recommend the Nook Touch.Battery: Depending on usage levels you don't have to charge it too often, I read on mine in breaks between classes and when I have an assignment for an English class and only have to charge it every couple of weeks.",[]
"Part of this is that I turn off the wireless connection when I'm not using it, which saves battery power.Usability: very easy to use, command prompts in setup were great and after that it's somewhat intuitive.",[]
"Once you have books or other materials in your library you can organize them onto ""shelves"" of your own choice.",[]
"Press lightly on the outside rim of the page to turn it either way, press buttons on either side to turn the page the same direction that you have been turning.",[]
"Press near the top right corner to ""bookmark"" the page, press in the middle of the screen to open up a small main menu (from which you can access your homepage, your library, the shop, settings, etc), press and hold over a word to highlight, mark, or look it up.","[('press', 0.14730083198461036)]"
"You can search through your books for a typed phrase or word (very handy when trying to find a certain passage for writing a paper, or in-class discussions!)",[]
"It also locks the screen, to unlock you press the n button and then slide your finger across the screen.Price: I have hundreds of books (some of them impossible to find in a physical copy), and I've spent less than $10 total on books.",[]
"Modern books cost less than a new physical copy, and there are amazing values of treasure trove books which only cost a dollar or two but house complete collections or hundreds of classics.",[]
Free books are not to be underestimated also!,[]
"I've only found one or two which hadn't been scanned in properly.Screen: you can adjust font, font size, and other features.",[]
Screen saver is a woodcut-like image of a classic author (my favorites are the Bronte Sisters or Jules Verne) or you may choose instead to show a nature scene (black and white photograph).,[]
"Since it's eInk, it really is like a printed page-- you need light to read it, but it doesn't stress out your eyes like a computer screen would.Service: I have never had a problem with my Nook, but if I did I can take it straight to the nearest Barnes and Noble to have it fixed.",[]
"Also, I've heard that you get free coupons and even occasionally a free book when you enter B&N; -- haven't gotten to try that feature out yet, my campus bookstore isn't officially a real B&N;, but I'm looking forward to it.Wifi: the Nook doesn't generate its own hotspot, but considering that practically everywhere you're going to go is jumping on the wifi bandwagon you shouldn't need one.","[('n', 0.16045385363082929)]"
You only need the internet when shopping for new books.,[]
"Once purchased I've yet to have a book that took even near 10 seconds to fully download -- and that includes a complete Shakespeare!It's thin, easy to carry-- mine's never gotten scratched in a light sleeve, and that's after carrying it around in both a purse and a big bookbag-- and generally wonderful.",[]
"I looked at both Kindle and Nook, and I'm really glad I got my Nook.",[]
"I love using it, have gotten compliments on it, and after seeing me use mine my mom wants one!",[]
Purchased this item for my husband's birthday.,[]
Charge it as indicated for 3 + hours and it would not turn on.,[]
Contacted customer service at Barnes and Noble and asked for help but they were unable to do anything.,[]
So have to wait to hear back from the company I bought it from for a return and then see if I can get a replacement that works.,[]
Very disappointed in this product.,[]
I've had all the other Nook's and this is the first that I truly love.,[]
"The touch screen is accurate and quick, there is no reflection at all, page turns are quicker than the other Nooks.",[]
"It's very light, the archiving and rating process is much much easier.",[]
Shopping is easier as well.,[]
"I'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook, now I love them equally.",[]
"Of all the Nooks, I think this is the best one, I love it.",[]
I only wish it was 3g.,[]
Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.,[]
"When I read on this Nook (just like the other 2), it doesn't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I'm not at my current page.",[]
"In this area, the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.",[]
I'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.,[]
I'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle.,[]
it caused my child to be more involved in reading and has now become a great reader thanks it was just what the doctor ordered,[]
"i have owned 2 different e books and used 4, this is my favorite so far.",[]
"the touch screen works better than i thought it would and seems scratch resistnant, i prefer it to the ones with buttons because you dont have to push to turn the page.",[]
"it has a great battery life, i have used mine for 2 months and only charged it twice, and i read for hours on end.",[]
"the screen has good resolution and is easy to read, even in the sun.",[]
"my favorite part about this ebook is that it is compatible with multiple software programs, my literati would only accept books from the sponsor website, and i have a whole library already on my computer so this has been a plus.my only complaint is that it sometimes freezes up and needs to be reset, this has happened probably 6 times, it always seems fine after rebooting but it is still annoying, i think it may be because mine was used.","[('times', 0.10549480957565062)]"
I bought myself the Nook Simple Touch ebook reader for Christmas and I'm so pleased that I did.,[]
"This model doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the others Nooks but, in my opinion, you don't need them.A note about battery life - it's amazing!",[]
I'm an avid reader and have only charged the Nook ONCE since Christmas (it's now late January).,[]
I didn't believe the battery life claim I read in the item description but it's true.,[]
"The device physically, is relatively good for the money.",[]
There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.,[]
The problem with the B&N; system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.,[]
"If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.",[]
"Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.","[('child', 0.1634913199576861)]"
"By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.",[]
"The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.",[]
"Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.",[]
"Furthermore, it would appear that B&N; is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.",[]
"By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.",[]
"I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.","[('device', 0.17628235729837904)]"
"While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.","[('n', 0.10549480957565062)]"
Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!,[]
Now that's what I call convenience.,[]
very comfortable.very reliable.,[]
a pleasure to hold in your hands.,[]
eyes do not get tired.a small price for such a device,[]
eBoook is realy simple touch reader whith a correct price and very useful on day by day travel to my office.It is exactly the device that I want.,[]
I thought it was a regular nook didnt realize it was so small.. Its okay though for my 8 year old,[]
"It seems to be a limited device, but it has potential  I think a good price it new should be about $55.00.",[]
"I have one as a backup to my kindle P.W there are two pros ,the SD card slot and it can be rooted, but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted.",[]
"Very very limited web browser no Facebook or anything useful, the browser on the the paperwhite is much better.",[]
It is a pretty well made device.It is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite.,[]
"Having previously owned a Kindle, I was not expecting that e-book readers had much improved over the last year.",[]
"Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers.",[]
"So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books.",[]
This didn't sit well with me.When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge.,[]
"(Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.)",[]
"The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations.",[]
Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility.,[]
"Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently.",[]
"While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format.",[]
"The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books.",[]
Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to.,[]
"What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.",[]
I really wanted a e-reader but they all seemed to cost way to much.,[]
This one works really well and was very affordable.,[]
"We have the old Nook reader, which we love.",[]
"We purchased this Nook at target for the same price as Barnes and Noble and Amazon.This Nook is smaller, which is nice.",[]
"It has a built in light, which is really nice.",[]
"And, it is touch screen, which is awesome!The only flaw I see thus far is that you can't resize the letters.",[]
"Apparently the letters are a standard size, I assume because of the size of the screen?",[]
"Anyway, I would like to make them smaller so that I can read more before turning the page.",[]
"However, that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new Nook tremendously.",[]
I like my Nook.,[]
"No, I love it.",[]
I'm sure Kindle is good too but this was in my price range and can read PDF and epub.,[]
I've read so  much on this thing since I bought it and I can't stress enough how much I don't miss hardback books.,[]
Those things were heavy!,[]
"I suppose if I wanted to look at lovely color illustrations I go back to my paper books but as far as I'm concerned, most of my reading is done on this now.No, you can't play games on it but you can read on it and that's what an ereader is for.",[]
:),[]
"I purchased this item for a gift and the feedback I had from the person I gave this item as a gift is that it is a great product, easy to use with good features like the dictionary, fast page flipping and battery charge that lasts for days.","[('gift', 0.15063070629942882)]"
While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years.,[]
However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires.,[]
Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to.,[]
I purchased the nook for my husband.,[]
It was a Christmas present.,[]
He absolutely loves it.My husband is 76 years old and is not very computer wise..but this e-reader is so easy to use hehas had no problem.And being able to change the text size is great.,[]
I would highly recommend thise-reader .,[]
And i would give it 5 stars..,[]
I have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it.,[]
"My mom owns a Kindle, one sister a Nook Color, another sister a 1st Edition Nook...so I've seen my fair share of e-readers.",[]
I did the research before I bought.,[]
I actually bought my dad a Kindle 3G for Father's Day.,[]
But the light weight of the Nook Touch was great for me.,[]
"I have problems with my hands and their abilities, so after a full day of commuting, typing, and writing, they've reached their peak.",[]
It was the right choice for me.,[]
"Although I consider my self a technological person, I can still appreciate the simplicity, yet effectiveness of the Nook Simple Touch.",[]
"It packs a nice sized touchscreen which works off e-ink allowing me to read without glare, even in the sun.",[]
"It is really easy to use, and has a surprising adept touchscreen.",[]
My only complaint is the soft buttons on the side which allow for easy page turning.,[]
They are to hard to push.,[]
Besides that I think this is a very viable option in the competitive ebook reader market.,[]
Love this eBook Reader.,[]
Simple to use.,[]
Easy to read screen.,[]
Am very pleased with this item and am satisfied with size.,[]
My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.,[]
"Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.",[]
Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.,[]
This is not the way to treat customers.,[]
I am canceling all my pre-orders and I will try a different ereader.,[]
I bought this as a Christmas present for my grand daughter and she is very pleased with it.,[]
I bought this because it seemed very easy for a 9 year old to use,[]
I bought it as a gift  last year!,[]
It looks like a person I gave it to uses it and likes it a lot.,[]
"Love all the options, easy to use and lots of fun reading great books.",[]
Would totally recommend a nook.,[]
Thank you,[]
My child already has a gaming system so she doesn't need anything for apps so this was the right thing for her.,[]
It is only for reading.She loves to read and this encourages that wonderful hobby.,[]
I am going to order the light that attaches to it though because it is harder to see than my nook color.,[]
"For a user who only want's the basics, this is perfect.",[]
"It's very simple and easy to use and it's small enough to carry in a purse, I just love it.",[]
You will keep your books forever which is my favorite part.,[]
The unit that was sent to me does not power on.,[]
I searched on the Internet and a lot of other people have the same issue.,[]
It seems there is a problem with the batteries on these units....,[]
"They are supposed to last for a long time, but mine did not even power on once.",[]
"It would be nice for the end user to be able to take the battery out and replace it; I am going to have to send mine back, even though I had to wait a while to get this one and was looking forward to use it, play with it, test it.",[]
"Ok, so I sent this one back and got the money back, but not the cost to send it back to seller.",[]
I bought a second one from another seller.,[]
"This one powered on, but had other serious issue with it.",[]
"I tried to insert a micro SD card, but the casing for the card reader was misaligned and my card fell in the device itself.",[]
"As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back.",[]
"Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow.",[]
I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out.,[]
"I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely.",[]
The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely.,[]
"I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device, but without damaging some places of the plastic cover.",[]
"I figured that 2GB of internal memory would be enough and I would be loading books on it through the USB connector, by connecting to a computer.",[]
But it turns out it does not have 2GB available internally to put books on.,[]
"It only has 250 MB, like other reviewers have mentioned.",[]
I do not know if I can root the device without a card reader to put a card in.,[]
"Have not tried to root it yet, but I read on the internet that it is possible.",[]
That would be the obvious solution to many of its software limitations.,[]
"I went ahead and bought a third device because I really want a book reader with an E-Ink screen that has a card reader and that one seems fine, but I did not played with it much.",[]
"I tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble.com, but they never posted it.",[]
Oh well.The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader.,[]
"If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you.",[]
The e-ink screen is amazing.,[]
It looks like you are reading a physical book.,[]
I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen.,[]
Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book.,[]
"This is very simple, which I love.",[]
"One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed.",[]
"Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble.",[]
"I found that between the B&N; store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free.",[]
No reason to pay for one of those ever again.,[]
"Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around.",[]
"Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs.",[]
"Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best.",[]
(FYI: It's costs less on the B&N; website.),[]
I love my eBook reader.,[]
"It is real easy to buy ebooks with it, almost to easy.The only drawback with it is that it is not glowlight one.",[]
"the only thing I can say I dislike is the fact that you are stuck buying books from b&n, hate that.",[]
like the reader.,[]
Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com.,[]
"In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.",[]
I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.,[]
"I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.",[]
"Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.",[]
"As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.",[]
"I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.",[]
"B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.",[]
"My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.",[]
"The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.",[]
You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories.,[]
"They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.",[]
"Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.","[('techies', 0.1453954976939716)]"
"It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading.",[]
"In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.",[]
"That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away.",[]
"I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.",[]
"I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.",[]
"Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.",[]
I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.,[]
"I bought it and love it.The Good StuffThe UI is a lot better than the Kindle (I bought one for my brother, so I felt the difference between them), it's really confortable to hold and read, the touch is great for navigating between de UI, but the physical buttons are my choice, takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the Kindle ones (that are too sensitive, I mean the basic edition), but that's a good thing since I avoid turn pages accidentaly.The structure is lightweight and really confortable, unlike Kindle, the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read (I have large hands), the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior.",[]
It's a pleasure to read on this thing.The Not so Good StuffNot sharing on sideloaded content.,[]
"If I sideload a book from other store, the sharing option gets unavailable.Not that many formats.",[]
Just Pubs and PDF.,[]
"I mostly read Pub files, but it would be great if they support other formats too.Not ""send to"" option.",[]
In kindle I fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless.,[]
"This thing doesn't have a feature like that, so WiFi is not as usable as it is on the Kindle.Overall a great product, I liked it more than the Kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read, better ergonomics, and the UI makes it feel a lot better.",[]
"Even though I knew that Amazon would be making changes in its ereader lineup very soon, I bought the Nook Touch (September 6, 2011).",[]
"Never had an ereader, so this was a careful purchase.",[]
"After reading as much as I could online, I got the Nook for the following reasons:1.",[]
Epub capability.,[]
"As of now, Kindle doesn't do epub.",[]
It is very easy to convert my Word documents to epub and sideload on to my Nook.,[]
The ubiquituous epub standard has opened a world of reading possibilities for me.,[]
There are a number of online websites that will allow you to upload Word docs and convert to epub for free.,[]
All the free ebook sites have their offerings in epub.2.,[]
PDF reading.,[]
"Likewise with epub, I can convert my documents to PDF and they look great on the Nook.3.",[]
Ease of sideloading.,[]
"Just connect to the PC, and the Nook appears as another drive.",[]
Just drag and drop from the desktop to the Nook and I'm in business.4.,[]
Touch screen.,[]
"Having a choice, I'd rather not have a physical keyboard.",[]
The Nook's touch screen just WORKS.5.,[]
Design.,[]
I really like (a) the rubberized coating.,[]
"Easy to grip, feels good.",[]
(b) the size.,[]
"Small, easy to carry around.",[]
(c) the page buttons.,[]
"The buttons are a little stiff, but I quickly got used to that.",[]
(d) the battery life.,[]
It's living up to it's claims so far.,[]
To not have to charge ANOTHER dang instrument every day is heaven.6.,[]
Library lending.,[]
I went to a local library that had the ebook capability.,[]
Got the library card.,[]
Went home and followed the instructions the library gave me.,[]
Voila!,[]
"I am reading a great book for free from the local library that would have cost me at least 10 bucks online.As I go forward, I'm sure there will be other things I'll discover about the device I like.",[]
"Right now, I can't keep my hands off it.",[]
OK so a rating of 1 for the product itself is unfair.,[]
"This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N; or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.",[]
"Various contacts via on-line support chat, telephone support and visits to Barnes and Noble stores have yielded the following:  The people on the other end of the conversation basically have no knowlege of the problem and direct you through a series of needless exercises in hopes that something will work.",[]
"If you escalate, you will eventually get to B&N; personnel who will acknowledge the problem and proceed to give you a non-answer.",[]
"If you compare this experience to the recent Kindle Fire problems you find Amazon.com stating they have a problem, what they are doing to fix it and an estimate of when things will be better.",[]
Recent announcements tell you that Amazon.com has followed through on this and that the first batch of fixes are already available.,[]
"Barnes and Noble, acting in a manner that is the reverse of Amazon.com, continues to let those with the Wi-Fi problem live with that problem.",[]
"While you will not find any reference to the problem on the B&N; site a Google search on ""Barnes and Noble Simple Touch W-Fi problems"" or a similar search, will give you a better feel for Simiple Touch owners who are struggling.",[]
SOLUTIONS:  Drive to another location where Wi-Fi works (suggested by one B&N; person).,[]
"For PC owners with Internet access, you can still connect to B&N; from your PC, buy your E-product, download it and transfer it to your Simple Touch.",[]
Your less technical friends and relatives or those who do not have a PC and rely on working wFi-Fi may not be so lucky.,[]
"Of course another solution would be to 1.Acknowledge the problem, 2.State and estimated date when a resolution may be available.",[]
3.Fix the problem and announce the fix.,[]
Amazon.com did this.,[]
Why can't Barnes and Noble?,[]
Good luck to those without this problem.,[]
"You have a nice light, long battery life E-reader that works well in appropriate lighting.",[]
The reading experience is quite nice.,[]
"And for 1.1.X, lets hope it doesn't introduce you to the Barnes and Noble problem resolution experience.2011-12-27: I continue to try to resolve this problem on my own and have so far determined that all other Wi-Fi devices (several) I own connect fine to my home network including a Nook Color (strange being it is from the same company).",[]
"Also, others who have recently visited my home and needed to connect to Wi-Fi had no problems going through my router with their devices.",[]
I drove to a McDonalds for a test as well with some of my devices.,[]
All my other devices connected to Wi-Fi at McDonalds including the Nook Color.,[]
"The Simple Touch ""found"" Wi-Fi at McDonalds but could not complete the connection using McDonald's ""proxy"" software where you had to comply before you could continue.",[]
The Nook Color was presented the acceptance message from the proxy through the browser on the Nook Color.,[]
"I may not understand the correct procedure on the Simple Touch, but it does not appear to be obvious.",[]
The Simple Touch did connect via Wi-Fi at B&N; and at my local library.,[]
Technicians I talked to advised against purchasing another router as a solution as the problem may also exist for other routers as well.,[]
Love my nook.,[]
It worked great.,[]
Until I had had it 13 months.,[]
Then it wouldn't take a charge and the screen would freeze when the battery was still full.,[]
They offered me a new nook for half price which means they know the nook doesn't last long.,[]
I will look into other products.,[]
I'm not going to pay 120.  for something with a non replaceable rechargeable battery that only lasts one year.,[]
"I have a decade's worth of ebooks in .pdf format (100+) and just never have read most of them due to not really enjoying reading a 50+ page ebook on my desktop or laptop....I thought if I got an eReader and loaded these onto it, I could and would then read them.....After doing several hours research on the internet and going to two Best Buy stores (sometimes good places to do research), I bought the Nook 'Simple Touch Reader'....my criteria is VERY different than the masses....I did not want 3G or even WiFi for both privacy and EMF health reasons....I am not the least bothered by downloading content to my desktop and then dragging to the eReader (which was incredibly easy by the way)....so keep in mind that what I want is probably not what you want....This Nook is fantastic...it was one of the easiest, most intuitive setups I've ever experienced...I didn't even read the Quick Start Guide...it did require WiFi for the setup and registration with B&N....you; must have an account which I already did...and then I easily turned off the WiFi which is recommended for stretching battery life anyway...this unit is light, compact, comfortable, highly functional, great touchscreen functioning, very good resolution and works well and simply....HOWEVER, the primary material I want to use it to read does not always format properly despite specification claims....I put a few .pdf ebooks on the unit and started reading....the primary flaws are:1. it often shows a paragraph break where there is none....2. sometimes a sentence just stops and starts up again several sentences or even a paragraph later with out-of-sequence content interspersed....in other words, for example it unexpectedly stops in the middle of paragraph 2, shows paragraph 3 & 4 and then picks up the rest of paragraph 2....3. sometimes there's just one word on a line and it's not the last word of a sentence.....and4.","[('wifi', 0.0419877468012819), ('paragraph', 0.02975921332636866), ('desktop', 0.029560125511536674)]"
"sometimes the copy just ends in the middle of a page when it's not the end of a paragraph or anything, just to continue at the top of the next page....None of these glitches are acceptable to me....they're all annoying and #2 totally distorts the meaning of the content...I'd give this unit the highest rating if the darn .pdf conversion worked correctly....so, I'm still looking for an eReader that works with pdfs...","[('middle', 0.0724135785035745)]"
Pros:Touch screenExcellent battery lifeSized well for pockets or pursesThe gestures are pretty intuitiveThe functionality of ePub books is very goodThe device is able to use books from other sources who use ePub or PDF format (library or other sourceCons:The on-board memory capacity is 236MB (!,[]
")Menu / keyboard items are not scalableNo parental filters / controlsNo on board method to manage files or memory usageThe small screen size decreases reading continuity at larger text sizes; no ability to view text in LandscapeApparently, Amazon really prefers you buy the Kindle, observing they are offering the NOOK for $40 more than for the price it is offered at Barnes and Noble.Summary:I own a Kindle and a NOOK Touch.","[('kindle', 0.11965382797868994)]"
"As I inventory the features, the NOOK seems to be superior.",[]
The reason is fundamentally that the navigation is made supremely more intuitive with the touch screen.,[]
The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly.,[]
"The keyboard, being onscreen, is highly readable, though there is no adjustment for typeface variation or size to resolve reading difficulty, which seems to render other accommodations for the visually impaired redundant.",[]
"What use is it to adjust the text inside the book, if it is difficult to read the menu and to navigate to the book in the first place?",[]
"Though it is worth saying again, all items are indeed highly readable even without the adjustment capacity on the menu / keyboard levels.",[]
"It is an improvement over the Kindle, which has the same weakness compounded with the static keyboard with low-contrast printed letters thereupon, and a more complicated menu system.When looking through the documentation that accompanies the device, and at BN.com, there is absolutely NO mention of the built-in memory whatsoever.","[('kindle', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"236MB is not a good selling point, but I find this evasive to completely hide this attribute from the consumer until having the device in hand and navigating the settings.",[]
It tarnishes my opinion of Barnes & Noble.,[]
"Were it not for the overall superiority of this device over others, I would question whether or not to do business with them.",[]
"That said, the ""offense"" is offset in part because I feel that most folks who would consider owning this device will already have a memory expansion on hand, probably left over after upgrading from early models of smartphones or cameras.There is no way to set the ""default"" storage to your memory expansion.",[]
"The only method I have discovered to direct how memory is utilized without hacking the device is by connecting / synchronizing with a computer and manually placing files in the preferred locations.What really sold me on this device was the touch screen, intuitive / simple menu system, and its ability to use books borrowed from the library.","[('device', 0.1460452130972918)]"
"The menus and on-screen keyboard functions, and the basic functions were learned within 2 weeks by my very elderly great-aunt.",[]
"She had never before used a similar computerized device, though the learning curve is similar to that of a microwave oven.",[]
"I believe this speaks well to the design team, though also indicates room for improvement.Regarding the ""Social"" features of the NOOK Touch: this is generally a nice feature.",[]
"One can synchronize with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, posting commentary and inviting discussion and response to the material being shared.",[]
THE DOWN SIDE is that this is only supported if Barnes and Noble actually sold the book to the user.,[]
Side-loaded material is not up for discussion.There is a lightly functional Web browser embedded in the Search function of the NOOK Touch.,[]
It is basically the equivalent of a Mobile Web browser.,[]
I have had some mixed success with it.,[]
"It does work, though I have found it to be rather unstable.",[]
"Of the 5 tests I've run with it, It has caused the device to crash on 2.",[]
This was navigating the mobile version of Facebook.,[]
"It was not advertised as a feature at all, so the fact that it exists is kind of an Easter Egg.",[]
"Things to note with it are that the pages it loads are more difficult to read, since the Web is rendered in color and when rendering into gray scale the contrast tends to be low.",[]
"However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.",[]
"I realize that this is not likely a highly common issue, but it was an assumption I had made before purchasing the device for my great-aunt.",[]
This issue is not specifically the NOOK.,[]
It is because the NOOK is running on Android (according to the developers of the WMWifiRouter application).,[]
"That said, the Kindle is also unable to access the Internet in this fashion.",[]
"It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.A case is a worthwhile consideration.",[]
"Carrying the NOOK in one's pocket can create some issues with the touch screen, and it tends otherwise to cause the device to crash.",[]
"However, I find that the so-called fashionable cases are absurdly priced.",[]
Consider at least two things before purchasing such items: they are made from cardboard wrapped in fabric; they are being offered for between $20 and $50.,[]
"If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.","[('device', 0.17659148842078326)]"
In full disclosure this is the first e-ink reader I have ever owned.,[]
"That being said, I've heard complaints from others about older models and have people at work compare their kindles to my nook touch and they think mine is sweet.",[]
"For me the size is perfect and once you play around with it, it is very easy to navigate.",[]
It only has wi fi and no 3G but that may not matter to some.,[]
I'm very happy with it so far and my only real complaint is that the B&N accessories are a little on the high side.,[]
"I mean really, you're paying 140 bucks for the reader, you shouldn't have to shell out $30 for a case.",[]
"Other than that, I think it's really cool and it doesn't have any of the web browser/mp3 nonsense on it that sucks anyway on e readers.",[]
"If you're on the fence regarding e readers, go with this one and help keep book stores alive!!",[]
!,[]
Make it simple the Nook is a better e-reader.,[]
"True, it does not have 3G, but my Kindle touch 3G stopped working almost right away and the 3G is only good for Amazon purchased content anyway.Moreover, nothing beats being able to go to Barnes and Noble to get customer service by an actual person instead of being transfered 3 times before reaching a semicompetent customer service agent.",[]
"You can also connect to a Barnes and Noble WiFi and read the books you want for free up to an hour.The Nook has one drawback, it does not have the Economist magazine available yet.",[]
As soon I the Economist is available for Nook I will dump my Kindle.,[]
The nook itself seems like a decent ebook reader but I am having issues and cannot buy books.,[]
I have tried multiple times to try and contact them but they never respond.Frustrated customer,[]
"I like it cause it's light, easy to use and has a most satisfactory screen.",[]
"I didn't rate it with the fifth star cause you can't read at night but apart from this, I 'm very satisfied for the month or so I'm using it.There are issues with B&N; registration and purchasing policies though, so here's a legal hack to overcome the registration process and use Nook offline.",[]
"Of course, you won't be able to use B&N; bookstore this way.Power it up but don't enter setup.",[]
"Hold the right/up &#34;button&#34; and drag your finger to the top of the screen, from left to right.",[]
"A &#34;Factory&#34; button appears, so press it and go to the &#34;Factory&#34; menu.",[]
"Again, Hold the right top key and tap somewhere in the emtpy space at the bottom right of the screen.",[]
A &#34;Skip Oobe&#34; frame should appear.,[]
Tap it and you are done.,[]

Also PDF format support is perfect.,[]
All of that without commercials and for same price as Amazon Kindle classic.,[]

But everything was in the box that was supposed to be and I did not see any signs of previous use on the item.,[]
It is up and running so all is well.,[]
"I was hesitant to purchase through an off-site provider, but it was delivered quickly and in great working order.",[]
"This is an update from my initial review.This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal.",[]
"It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund.",[]
"The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days.","[('seller', 0.18836149495996607)]"
"My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!","[('blueproton', 0.09492976179352822)]"

"Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once.",[]
"Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books.","[('library', 0.10549480957565062)]"
"The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software.","[('ebooks', 0.05516766515132153)]"
"The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.",[]
";The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.","[('towards', 0.05037136929247582)]"
"With all the weekly magazines going digital, this is a nice device for use when reading magazines along with breakfast.",[]
Works great with books too!,[]
!,[]
"though the shelving system is quite troublesome and i don't have the option to delete books from the nook, it certainly serves well as an ereader",[]
It got here very quickly.,[]
It was a gift for my mom and she uses it all the time.,[]
She loves it.,[]
It was easy for her to learn how to use and she reads off of it almost everyday.,[]
It is a great product.,[]
This is an easy-to-use basic ebook reader.,[]
My wife especially likes it because of its simplicity of operation.,[]
"However, right now it is totally frozen.",[]
I cannot turn it on or off.,[]
This is not the first time either.,[]
We have had it refuse to connect to wi-fi before and had it freeze up before.,[]
"I will take it in to a Barnes and Noble store when I get the chance, however that is about a 2 1/2 hour trip for me.",[]
What I have been told is that software upgrades are often buggy and create these types of issues.,[]
It seems oftentimes when they have buggy upgrades it then takes several days or weeks to fix them.,[]
While I like the Nook when it works it gets frustrating to deal with the issues.,[]
"Nook is awesome!The name sucks tough :)The price-quality ratio is great and this ereader, once rooted and running on android, can read just about any file type, no longer limited to epub and PDF (terrible format for ereaders).The delivery came way ahead of schedule, that was a pleasant surprise.So thanks AceElectronix and Barnes&Noble;!","[('barnes', 0.08916266806165124)]"
Ordered for a freind.,[]
"As far as I know, his daughter is happy with it.",[]
I guess you could call him.,[]
Terrible unit and customer service is even worse.I received this new as a Christmas gift.Was defective right out of the box.,[]
Pages flicker and blank out randomly.Contacted B/N several times by email and was told this is normal.,[]
Called yesterday and spent 45 minutes on the phone trying to resolve the issue and get a refund.Was told they would not issue a refund even though the unit does not work properly.,[]
"They did offer to send me a reconditioned one if I sent the defective one back at my exspense.So if they have reconditioned ones on hand it makes sense that there are issues that they refuse to admit to.So I receved a brand new defective unit and they will replace it with a used defective unit at my exspense.With customer service like this it's no wonder so many of their brick and mortar stores are closing.Guess I'm stuck with an exspensive paperweight as the company is not willing to resolve the issue.To make matters worse , I bought a Kindle as a gift for the same person who bought this for me.The Kindle works great and in my opinion is a far better device.I plan to try once more by contacting them again and if I can return the unit I will put the money to good use and purchase a Kindle .I've been dealing with Amazon for around 10 yrs now and have never had an issue with any purchase or product.Buyer beware.","[('purchase', 0.05815953972742755), ('exspense.so', 0.037370895877910086)]"
The reader is great except you cant use it until you register it.,[]
Went to the library and couldnt get on their wifi to do it.,[]
Nor could I use macdonalds where they have the at&t hotspot they promised would work.,[]
The nook wouldnt let me do it anywhere but a Barnes and Nobles store so I didnt get to use it for almost 2 weeks.,[]
Then I made my first purchase of an ebook...1 book...and they double charged me.,[]
once through barnesandnoble.com and again through barnesandnoble/marketplace.,[]
They appoligized but wouldnt be putting the money back for 5 days.,[]
Since this was cash money they took off my debit card I was just out for days...wonder what would have happened if Id bought 10 books?,[]
"The nook seems to work great now that I can use it, but using barnes and noble for you ebooks might not be the best idea.",[]
They admitted they were having a problem with the double dipping and were trying to fix it.,[]
I had it happen 2 years ago when I ordered on line to have paper backs sent to me.,[]
So it hasnt been fixed in 2 years:( But I like the nook!,[]
"This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.",[]
"Now knowing these two VERY IMPORTANT points, I can enjoy my &#34;Nook 2&#34;.",[]
Its a good ereader.,[]
"How it compares to the kindle, I dunno I seen raves and complaints for both.For an ereader I love the nook.- battery life is awesome.",[]
"would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators.- the display looks great, even in direct sunlight more or less.- The simple touch looks cool, very simplistic.",[]
no buttons all touchscreen for the most part.- The extra $40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook.covers anytype of damage from what I understand.- Not as many CCNA/cisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast.- No addswhat I dont like;- only comes with 200mb of internal memory.,[]
"You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it.",[]
"Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.",[]
"This was the first time I have used Amazon for electronics, and I was not disappointed!The Nook was a gift for my Freshman daughter, and she loved it...thanks!",[]
My 9 year old grandson asked me for a NOOK for his birthday.,[]
I never heard of a &#34;NOOK&#34;!,[]
I bought this one and I am enjoying it so much that I want one for myself.,[]
I see the days of the text-book becoming a thing of the past.,[]
"Get this, you'll be very satisfied.",[]
Easy on the eyes.,[]
Great Job B&N.,[]
It great for what I use it for.,[]
To read books.,[]
"They say the battery life would last over a month, but I haven't been able to go that long.",[]
"on time delivery, product as listed, great reader and simple to use even for a beginner would recommend just like reading a book",[]
This is an excellent choice for an ereader.,[]
It does exactly what it's suppose to do.,[]
I would recommended it to anyone looking for an ereader at an affordable price.,[]
My Kindle broke and I replaced it with an extremely cheap Nook.,[]
Since then I have been extremely disappointed.,[]
I only expect three things out of an e-reader and was shocked to learn that the Nook fails on two of the three counts.1.,[]
The actual reading:They both do the job.,[]
"In fact, I slightly prefer the Nook to the Kindle in terms of form, ease of reading, and the presence of a physical button.2.",[]
Wifi Connectivity:What the **** is the point of having wifi if you can only use it for downloading purchases from B&N.,[]
;  I expect to practically NEVER make a purchase from the official store.,[]
Instead I use an e-reader for my personal files (textbooks and news articles for example) and am left having to connect the device to my computer every.,[]
single.,[]
time.,[]
Unbelievable shortcoming of the Nook.3.,[]
"SoftwareI can't see how far I've read, I can't edit file names, AND WORST OF ALL I CAN'T DELETE???????????!!?!!?!?!!?!",[]
"wtf B&N;, wtf.This product is really just awful in comparison.",[]
"Annoying to say b/c I was unhappy with Amazon in relation to what happened to my Kindle.Two stars because it does actually work, but that seems a bit generous...",[]
The Nook simple Touch is a brilliant creation by Barnes and Noble!,[]
"I have had mine for 3 months and have been overly satisfied with the simple touch screen, vast book store, and wonderful setup.",[]
"As a great competitor to the Kindle the Nook has many ups and few downs, whereas the Kindle is good in its own way, but doesn't even come close to the Nook.",[]
I love my Nook Simple Touch and would recommend it to anyone.,[]
"was given as a gift, she loves it and has given her many hours of pleasure, reading lots of books.",[]
"Good article, the best on the market.",[]
Good quality and high performance.,[]
Meets my expectations.,[]
Easy to use and made to last.,[]
I only used it a few times because the screen marks the words hard to see.,[]
I would not recommend this product to anyone.,[]
Got this for my niece for Christmas and she said its works great downloaded alot of books already  she uses it all the time.,[]
This was a gift for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.,[]
It was easy for her to understand and use on her own.,[]
Bought this as a gift for my father-in-law and he has not put it down since!,[]
Great buy for the money.,[]
Quality is top notch.,[]
I would buy one again in a heartbeat.,[]
Came packaged very well for shipping.,[]
The Nook is perfect.,[]
I've already read 2 books on it since I got it and it's absolutely worth buying.It took me under a minute to understand how it functions and connected it without hick-ups to my computer to personalize the screensaver and load books on it.,[]
"Even though the nook can be a potentially great e-reader, the reading experience for an e-reader is most important - and that's where this falls extremely short.The biggest obstacle comes to the usage of the dictionary.",[]
Why must I revert to my phone's dictionary app over and over because this e-reader doesn't do its job properly?,[]
"What a hassle!- In almost all e-books, it does not highlight words to look up where, on the line, there is not enough room to finish the word, adding a dash, and continuing it on the next line.",[]
"Changing text to different sizes makes different words end up with this fate, so the problem is internal.-The dictionary is limited to highlighted words.",[]
You cannot search the dictionary directly.,[]
You cannot additionally select words in the definition.,[]
"So basically, in a lot of instances, you will get a definition that doesn't help - where highlighting ""unknown word"", such as with a suffix -ly, and getting a definition that says...having qualities of ""unknown word"".",[]
And you have reached a dead end.-The dictionary is very limited in scope.,[]
"There are many definitions this doesn't have that my phone's dictionary ends up being used.I praise b&n; for making nice features for this...nice graphics, memory card slot, etc....but if graphics were my main concern, I would have bought a LCD tablet.",[]
"Create a strong and exquisite foundation for a great reading experience and add graphics on top, rather than adding modernity to a product at the cost of the quality of the reading experience.",[]
"I would have preferred mediocre graphics but the most complete and navigational dictionary possible, rather than the present setup.",[]
I'm very happy with my item.,[]
The delivery was fast also.,[]
I bought this item used but in great conditon and a very good price.,[]
I got this as a  birthday gift from my kids.,[]
I was really excited to get a reader but because of some diabetic retinopathy I couldn't read it well.,[]
I need something with a backlight.,[]
I tried to take it back to Barnes and Noble to purchase a more expensive one that I could use but as always they were not willing to help me.,[]
They are the worst at customer service I have ever seen.,[]
I won't buy anything from them ever again.,[]
They are just unwilling to help.,[]
They always have a very lame excuse.,[]
I've asked my kids not to buy anything for me from them every again.,[]
I sure won't.,[]
"This NOOK is of no use to me at all, it's not easy to use or easy to read and I just wanted to trade it in, pay more for something I could use but they said sense I had opened the package and tried to use it that I could not return it.",[]
Now I have a NOOK that is of know value at all to me and a store that is unwilling to help me in any way even though I had a receipt and an unused product.,[]
I will buy product from Amazon because they are so good to support their customers but I won't buy any product that is a Barnes and Noble.,[]
product at all.,[]
"I've had my NST since last July, and I've been very happy with it.Pros:- Battery life when wifi is off is as good as advertised.- The page turn rate was already fast, but the update last November made it super speedy.",[]
"Seriously, I've played with the current e-ink Kindles, and the difference in refresh rate might SEEM small on paper, but in practice it's a very noticeable difference.- I never had the wifi problems others did after the November firmware update, but I understand that the latest firmware update should solve it.- The NST feels really nice when you're holding it, and I really like that there are physical page turn buttons in addition to the onscreen touch turning - I use both, depending on whether I'm sitting up or lying down when I read, etc.- Navigation is very intuitive.- I bought a $5 4gb micro SD card and have had no problems using it with the NST.- Sideloading non-DRMed, non-B&N; content downloaded from places like Project Gutenburg is very easy, and it all goes into the same library as your B&N; downloaded content.Cons:- The user interface is easy to use, but it's also VERY basic, and there are very few features.","[('n', 0.07593323417401807)]"
"You can organize your books into ""shelves,"" but only on the device itself, and it's a cumbersome process.",[]
"You can sort books by title, author, and date added, and... that's pretty much it.",[]
"The NST isn't a tablet and I don't want it to be, but there are still some pretty simple features that don't seem like it would have been that hard to add, and more flexible organization is one of them.- Once a book's in the library, you can't really see anything about it besides the title and author.",[]
"Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.That's about it.",[]
"My cons list is really more of a wishlist, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the NST to anyone, especially at the lowered $99 price.",[]
"I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.",[]
"- fashionable design, I particularly like the white rim- the page turn buttons are sturdy(while others complained about the ""stickyness"" I actually preferred it)- love, love, love the shelves option - I work at a library and enjoy putting things where the",[]
Device froze on start page and is now unusable.,[]
Replaced with Kindle simple touch.,[]
Both my wife and I use Kindle and are very happy.,[]
I bought it for a good friend.,[]
She loved it and said it was the only one her school would let her use to get school books.,[]
It will save her a lot of money.,[]
I was very reluctant to give up real books.,[]
But after getting my nook I realized all the space I've been saving by not having a bookshelf.,[]
I t also makes it easier to read laying down when you don't have to use both heads to awkwardly hold up the book.,[]
The nook is very light and easy to carry around with you .,[]
It came in only three days on Christmas no less.,[]
it came in the original box and everything.,[]
i couldn't be happier with my grandmas new Nook.,[]
it is really good and portable i can take it when i go to Florida.,[]
"though it does not have a back light, i truely enjoy it.",[]
My husband loves his Nook so much.,[]
"It's easy to use, holds a charge for a long time and stores many many books.",[]
Easy to read with no glare.,[]
Wish the screen were a bit brighter & that current books were available for less.,[]
It works great though and I'm looking forward to leaving heavy hardback books at home.,[]
The screen is excellent in both dim light and bright sun.,[]
"While I have lots of books, they are not all epub or pdf format.",[]
The Nook needs the ability to read more than just 2 formats.,[]
That restriction is the main reason for the 2 stars.,[]
My last reader handled about 8 different formats.,[]
"It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month",[]
I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best.,[]
Why?,[]
I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook.,[]
Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.First the Nook feels better.,[]
It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant.,[]
It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages.,[]
And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident.,[]
"Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from.",[]
Plus the size options all make sense.,[]
For instance on the Kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small I can't see why anyone would use them and to me it's a waste.Fourth the buttons are all well placed.Fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures.Go try one today.,[]
I'm fairly confident you'll love it.....unless you don't.,[]
I brought it for gift and price was right.,[]
I think she was very happy with it and she love to reads.,[]
The Nook simple touch e-book does all it purports.,[]
I had a few difficult moments trying to download some books.,[]
I am not that computer savvy yet but I managed.,[]
I viewed a how-to video to find out about other functions of the book.,[]
I am still learning.,[]
Nook could provide some sort of introductory leaflet describing how to access the e-book's different functions.,[]
"I look the book and enjoy reading while waiting at the Doctor's office, etc.",[]
this thing was a paperweight from the mint I opened it.,[]
and the customer service is just awful.,[]
it wont let you go any father unless you register the device and since it would not let me do it I could not use it.,[]
went back to the Kindle,[]
"I bought the nook for my self, but my husband took it over.",[]
He studies his bible with it.,[]
I could never have bought a better gift for him,[]
"Easy to read, use, great for laying against leg as it does not slip so hands and arms are more relaxed.",[]
Two different options for turning pages as one reads is very useful.,[]
"The changing of the pages (on all ereaders) must be gotten use to, but not a bad negative.Excellent way to approach a more green world, read old, new books, and enjoy life.",[]
Ordered for our granddaughter for Christmas.,[]
She asked for it last year after seeing mine.,[]
She started using it right away.,[]
"Been in the market for an e-reader, I have tried to read on a tablet and it really just tires my eyes.",[]
Really when you are looking for an e-reader there are two brands you look at: Amazon and Barnes & Noble.,[]
"I have tried both and you really can't go wrong with either reader.However, the Nook Touch is currently the best e-reader available because of two major features:1.",[]
Touch screen2.,[]
"Short bodyOk, so the Nook has no keyboard because of the touch screen, which makes this guy even more portable than the Kindle.",[]
Its the size of a small pamplet and weighs slightly more.,[]
"You wouldn't think that this makes a difference, but it is almost pocket sized and with the same size screen as the Kindle.Finally, but most importantly is the touch screen.",[]
The current trend in electronics is toward touch screens and there is a reason why.,[]
"With out sounding too vague, it just ""feels more natural"".",[]
Want to turn the page?,[]
"swipe, like you would if you were turning a real page.",[]
"No button presses, or having to look away from the page, just gently flick the screen.",[]
"Its so simple, but really makes a big difference and that really sums up the Nook.",[]
My NOOK 1st Generation got run over.,[]
"It was covered under the damage warrantee,  but 1st Gen is not available any longer.",[]
"So I could have my choice of either NOOK color, or the simple touch.",[]
I am so glad I chose the simple touch.,[]
"It does not do music,  audiobooks or videos.",[]
No games.,[]
"Just your basic, no frills, dedicated reader.",[]
That is all I need.,[]
"I expected the transition from the old NOOK to the new one to be difficult,  but it was actually seamless and quite painless.Several reviews I've read complained that transferring reading material from one to the other was difficult and time consuming.",[]
"However, I found it to be very easy.",[]
"All I had to do was register the Simple Touch in my account,  and my books appeared as if by magic.",[]
"I did have to ""help"" some of them,  but that was easy too, requiring just a touch on the download prompt.The touch keypad is larger and easier to use than on the 1st Gen, although with ""fat fingers"" or poor hand control,  a stylus makes a nice aid.Someone in another review forum said that the Simple Touch lacks the ability to highlight and make notes.",[]
This is absolutely not so.,[]
"In fact,  these functions are actually easier than with the older device.",[]
Bookmarking has also been improved.,[]
"You get not only the page number,  but also a partial quote from the first line on the page.Another review stated that there is no provision made for preventing unauthorized purchases.",[]
This also is untrue.,[]
The owner may enable a password if desired.Navigating within a given book is much easier.,[]
"I have several devotionals,  Bibles and resource books and accessing various sections and chapters is incredibly simple.I would definitely buy the Simple Touch again.",[]
I would give it as a gift.,[]
I have already recommended it to friends.I did not care for any of the Barnes & Noble covers for the Simple Touch.,[]
"So I bought this onerooCASE Executive Leather Portfolio (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Barnes and Noble Nook Simple Touch / Nook Simple Touch with Glow LightIt is absolutely fantastic, and inexpensive but not in any way cheap!!",[]
!,[]
"I only have my NOOK for three weeks, but I'm very happy with it.",[]
Already read four books on it and it reads just as easy as a paper book.,[]
"Battery lasted only three weeks instead of two months (but depends on the amount of pages you turn, and I turned quite a lot of them ;p), but the battery is charged within three or four hours,so no big deal.",[]
"Nice, light weighted, compact e-reader, with good screen and enough options to change font,font size, etc.",[]
Also very quick delivery to Europe with Amazon (within a week!).,[]
Good price vs. quality.,[]
"For Europeans, don't buy the extra adapter, because it's American only and it's easy to charge via pc.",[]
"If you're looking for an alternative to paper books, this is a great device.",[]
"I also bought a NOOK cover from B&N: very pretty, but a little expensive I think, the back crinkles very quick and it takes a while to ship to Europe.",[]
"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is in the Army currently.",[]
She loves it to death and then some!,[]
"The only thing I would have changed is to have purchased the one with the lighted background for night time reading, otherwise I love it.",[]
"It is small and compact enough to make holding for long periods of time very easy, and Barnes and Noble has a hue collection of free books!",[]
"The hidden browser is a bit iffy, though.",[]
"I bought this for my wife, but now she wishes she had a tablet that could download apps.",[]
"I tried to get her to let me send it back for an upgrade - but she said, ""Aw, its ok."" That is not what I want to hear from my wife ever again.",[]
If you love your partner and yourself - upgrade it for your own benefit.,[]
Bought this for my daughter.,[]
"She is having difficulty with the pass word, and is finding that its functionality is very limited.",[]
At first I was torn between the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Paperwhite.,[]
I chose the Nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book.,[]
"I had though that the Nook did not have a good dictionary function, but learned otherwise after it's purchase.",[]
"All one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the Look Up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left.Sharp resolution, useful utilities, convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen.","[('word', 0.13685284542644136)]"
"Lightweight, durable and well designed.",[]
Essay to download free books (I suggest Project Gutenberg).,[]
"For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory.",[]
Barnes and Noble only allocates 1/4 of a GIG out of 2GIG for your personal library from non Barnes and Noble books.,[]
One gig for software to run the Nook and 3/4 for books purchased from Barnes.,[]
The best buy for external memory is 8 GIG.,[]
I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.,[]
"Love it.This baby reads books from many sites on the web, from B&N; and from my local library.",[]
"I have read them all with simple file managment.Personaly I prefer Amazon and wish I could buy books here, as we buy everything else here.",[]
"But unfortunaly my test kindle file would not work on the nook, not the nooks fault as it reads files from everyone else.Choose the nook for it's simple touch.",[]
We own two of these one for my 11 year old and the other for my wife and I to share.It looks cool.,[]
Works well.,[]
And our local library has a nice selection.,[]
"Chose this over the kindle for looks, simple touch features and the library support.",[]
I know if B&N; ever fails I can still get e books anyplace else.,[]
I REALLY LIKE THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE NEW NOOK.,[]
GREAT LONG BATTERY LIFE AND EASIER TO USE .,[]
I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.,[]
The devise worked for 30 minutes or less and quit.,[]
"I took it to Barnes and Noble to see if they could help, thinking it was my fault.",[]
No luck.,[]
Then I called the Nook Help Line!!,[]
OMG  They speak broken English.,[]
I spoke to about 6 different people.,[]
If you question is not on their script.... forget.,[]
Like &#34; can you told me what Nook you got?&#34;  Buy a Kindle.,[]
I was very hesitant to buy a book reader because I really like holding my books.,[]
I changed my mind when I bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately.,[]
This Nook is great.,[]
It is so much lighter than my IPad to read with.,[]
I find that I use it a lot.,[]
"I know this borderline heresy on Amazon's website, however, I truly prefer the Nook experience over the Kindle!",[]
My main reason is no ads!,[]
"Why be tricked into paying $100 for a Kindle that spams you with advertisements when you can cut out the middleman and get an ad-free Nook?To be clear, Amazon has 2 identical Kindle Touch versions: with and without advertisements.",[]
You can only get the ad-free version online (for $140) or shell out $40 AFTER you buy the unit.,[]
What?,[]
This is clearly a bait-n-switch because none of this is mentioned if you buy it in a physical store.The Nook comes with no advertisements and is a wonderful reading experience!,[]
"The touch screen is intuitive and responsive, the ebooks look great, and best of all, no hidden ads!",[]
This replaces a suitcase full of books for beach vacations and is easy to hold and easy to read in sunlight.,[]
I order Item.,[]
After first use it has just one died point.,[]
"But after every day it adds and adds, more and more.",[]
"I guess i got what i paid for, considering i paid less than 30 for it.",[]
works sparingly.,[]
should have waited and spent my hard earned money else where.,[]
"In my opinion, the Nook Simple Touch is the best e-reader on the market because... well... it's simple.",[]
"No distractions of email or social media, it lets me immerse myself in a book and I love it!",[]
I went on the market and started doing my research with one goal in mind.,[]
Find an e-book reader.,[]
"I was tempted by the more tablet-ey devices, but what it came down to is anything that a tablet could do, my android based phone was more than capable of handling.",[]
"I wanted a device that I could read outside in bright Texas sunshine between classes, or cuddle up before bed under a light with...Like 99% of people out there, it came down to the Kindle vs the Nook...They both boast pretty much the exact same screen, with the exact same size...the Kindle just has the added physical keyboard while the Nook uses a touch interface so simple/intuitive my grandmother was handling it naturally within minutes.The differences in the available markets did not concern me, as all my books are sourced through 3rd party providers, and my library is managed on my computer by a program called Calibre (pronounced Caliber for us Americans).The screen is crisp, very little ghosting, and it only does the black/white screen flash every 6th page turn...something I hardly notice.","[('kindle', 0.059663930802464585)]"
"The unit itself is incredibly light, lighter than a standard paperback, and has a rubberized finish that holds well in my average-to-smaller hands for a guy.",[]
"The two buttons on either side of the screen are a little hard to push at first, but I've noticed that over the past week, the two I use most have ""worn in"" and, while still requiring a small amount of tension, are plenty comfortable to activate even in a late-night delirious stupor brought on by a case of the one-more-chapter's.Also, due to the touch interface, I find that no matter how I hold the unit, or using whichever hand, I can easily navigate pages.",[]
"You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N; is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.",[]
Don't ever buy anything from this person/company!,[]
It was sold by BlueProton!,[]
"I contacted them to return the Nook, got a flat No.",[]
I bought it for my husband and then we found out he was being deployed and couldn't use it where he was going.,[]
"I sent an e-mail directly to them and never got a response, nothing at all !!",[]
"The Nook is very plain, nothing to it.",[]
"If you want to get something like this, Kindle is the way to go!!",[]
!,[]
I bought this for my elderly father.,[]
He can maneuver quite well through it.,[]
It was a good buy.,[]
We have run out of room for any more books.,[]
"I've had a nook for almost a year now and I spend all my time trying to download files, renew books from the library (the only lend for two weeks), and mess with files that won't open for whatever reason.",[]
Then I have no time left to actually read anything and I'm left frustrated and annoyed.,[]
"E-readers seem great in theory, but are a nightmare in practice.",[]
"I guess I can't speak for the kindle, but using our Nook to borrow from libraries has been a total waste of time.",[]
Do yourself a favor and stick to the printed books.,[]
"No hassle, you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries, and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends, pass it on to your kids, sell it at a garage sale, etc.",[]
All the copyright protection surrounding e-books makes them absolutely a horrible value for the money you spend and a waste of time on top of it all.,[]
"And when you leave your e-reader in the taxi, at the restaurant, or some opportunistic thief snatches it when your not looking, you are out $100.",[]
What thief would target your $6 paperback?,[]
"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.",[]
Very happy with condition of Nook eBook Reader.,[]
Fits what I wanted perfectly and very good touch screen.,[]
Came in time that was promised and was packaged well.,[]
Very happy!,[]
Readability in Sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen; can't be beat!,[]
The blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine!,[]
I like the Android operation too.,[]
I purchased a Nook in Chicago in 10/2011.,[]
I explained to the salesperson that I lived outside of the US and needed assurance that the device would work outside the US.,[]
I was assured that there was no problem.,[]
I paid for the Nook with my non-US credit card.,[]
I returned to Guatemala the next day.,[]
I excitedly booted up my Nook only to find out that it would not work with a non-US credit card.,[]
I immediately contact the Nook on-line support.,[]
They told me that I would have to return the Nook within 15 days to get a refund.,[]
"I explained that was impossible as I was in Guatemala.I asked if B&N; would pick up the shipping charges as my only option would be FedEx (very costly)Of course, they said no although it was their mistake.",[]
"Amazon would have picked up the charges.Finally, after begging for over an hour, B&N; agreed to allow me to return the Nook later than the 15 days.",[]
A friend was returning to the States in Nov and generously agreed to send the Nook back.I was told I would get a refund in 2=3 weeks.,[]
I didn't receive it.,[]
I e-mailed B&N; three times.,[]
No response.,[]
"Finally, I had an online chat with the support center and learned that my credit card was credited on Jan 9.No one had written me to let me know this had happened.",[]
"When I asked the very helpful customer rep why no one had returned my e-mail, she said it was a different department that handles e-mails.Just awful.",[]
DON'T BUY A NOOK IF YOU NEED CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!,[]
!s,[]
"I'm a bit of an android fan, so when the nook product line was first announced, I was onboard (I skipped the kindle because I didn't want a big keyboard cluttering up the space).",[]
"I got it at launch, and used it frequently.",[]
"Then... the iPad came out, and I found that when the B&N; eReader app came out, I was bringing my nook with me less, because, hey, I could just use the iPad to read, right?",[]
"Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.)",[]
worked just as well?,[]
So I sold the nook.Then a funny thing happened.,[]
I stopped reading as much.,[]
"See, with the iPad I was watching videos, playing games, messing around with apps, etc.",[]
"Which is great, but I just ended up opening things other than the eReader app.",[]
"At the time this dawned on me, I immediately thought ""If only there was a smaller form factor for the nook, I'd probably take that with me more, and start reading again...""Enter the nook touch.",[]
"It's much smaller, much lighter, and ditches the color touchscreen (which was frankly always a bit of a pain) at the bottom of the device.",[]
"What you're left with is a lean, mean, reading machine.",[]
It's not without its flaws.,[]
"I'm not going to touch on the platform itself (the original nook and nookColor reviews cover that pretty extensively), but I did want to talk about some of the differences from the eyes of an original nook owner.Even for a techie like me, I struggled with the interface at first, so here's a few items of note:The Good/Notable:- You can both tap the screen on the left or right side (left meaning page back, right meaning page forward) OR swipe left/right to turn pages.- Additionally there's buttons under the rubber on the left and right side of the front of the device.",[]
"This has been an absolute boon for one-handed reading, which happens constantly for me with a device so light.",[]
"Switching hands still gives me the power to paginate without having to change back.- Overall, the speed/snappiness of the device blows away the speed on the original nook + 1 update (i.e.",[]
the time when I ended up selling the nook).,[]
"Page turning is near instant, the on/off speed and unlocking is far faster too.",[]
With one exception...The not-so-good:- The keyboard is pretty slow.,[]
Still.,[]
The infrared sensor that's used to detect touch requires a lot of patience and single-letter typing.,[]
This was really only an issue on initial setup for the wifi at my home.,[]
I honestly haven't used the keyboard in about a month.,[]
"If I want to buy something, I do it via my phone's nook app, or the web.-  While my battery life is good *now*, it wasn't so good when I first got it.",[]
I had to run it down completely a few times and recharge before I started getting anything near the 1-month advertised time.,[]
"It's more like 2-3 weeks now that it's baked in, but that beats the original nook I had, and honestly, if you can't be troubled to charge the thing overnight once every 3 weeks, I'm not sure what to say.",[]
"Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.","[('touchscreen', 0.07241357850357448)]"
For cheaper than the original nook.,[]
The Nook Simple Touch E-reader is a great tool.,[]
I use it often in all kinds of locations.,[]
Originally I was concerned when it did not connect to my wi-fi but I went on to B&N and did their download and it worked fine after that.,[]
It is exactly what is it says it is.,[]
The screen quality is amazing.,[]
"Some of the transissions are not efficient, but overall it is a nice reader.",[]
Bought a Nook in Bangkok _Sort of happy with it_Then_ just browsing a store where a lady was demo-ing a Kindle_Sooooooo much better_Bought one & haven't looked at a Nook since,[]
I just bought the kindle and I'm regretting it.,[]
"Who ever said that the kindle has a better library is telling lies B&N has an equal or better ebook and ""app"" library.",[]
Im about to return it because the Nook is a better e-reader and has better features.,[]
I'm just happy I havent thrown my Kindle package away because i'm returning it after 3 days.,[]
Kindle would be better for my mom or grandmother but for me.,[]
Its a No!,[]
I bought is for my sis in law for her birthday and she really enjoys it.,[]
she's only had it a couple days and has already downloaded so many books.,[]
"I tried to switch the reader on, but nothing!It didn't work, even after more than 40 hours of charge!",[]
!,[]
I bought a NST from Books-A-Million.,[]
"LIke Amazon, B&N; tries to lock readers in to purchasing from their store, but if you're resistant, it's easy to side-load books using Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre on either device.",[]
I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen.,[]
This proved a prudent choice since the touch screen on the NST started malfunctioning about 6 months in.,[]
"At first, using a Q-Tip to clean the edges of the screen worked (it's not a calibrated screen, but works using light sensors that can be blocked by dust).",[]
Then certain areas of the screen completely stopped working.,[]
"I could not access my library, etc.",[]
"I'll spare you the details of my four infuriating chats with B&N; customer service, but I ended up returning my Nook more than two weeks ago for them to look at and replace with a functional unit.",[]
"I have heard nothing about its status since.Compare this to the customer service I received from Amazon when our work Kindle malfunctioned -- they replaced it without a murmur, after an actual phone conversation with an actual person.",[]
"I sent in the old unit and we had a new one three days later.I think in a lot of ways the NST is superior to the Kindle Touch -- epub format, side buttons, ability to be hacked and used as a tablet -- but if I end up having to buy another ereader, I will seriously consider converting my ebook library to mobi and purchasing a Kindle, because if (when) something goes wrong with my ereader, I want someone to care.","[('ereader', 0.1282593921605796)]"
"I'm sure I'll eventually get a response from B&N; and maybe a replacement Nook, but the hoop-jumping is a bummer.",[]
"I didn't order my Nook from Amazon but all I can say is, that it is AMAZING!",[]
This nook is for the people who are major readers like me.,[]
I mean I can rip through 3 - 5 books depending on the length.,[]
"You have to think that I don't always buy the books, I check them out with my library's Overdrive.",[]
"Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit.",[]
"I like to read all day, and it kind of sucks that I'm not able to read in the dark without any additional accessories.",[]
The battery life is great.,[]
"I charged it on Christmas night, and the charge is still over 85%.They could have made the power button a little easier to push because I have trouble telling if i have pushed it or not.",[]
"If your not the biggest reader, and you like to play gives, I recommend getting the Nook Tablet or Kindle Fire, NOT THE NOOK COLOR!",[]
"The nook color is supposed to be terrible at everything.I have no problems with my nook, I love it, and I am happy with it.",[]
"I bought the Nook Touch instead of the Kindle because it was on sale for $75, which is still alot to pay for something that can only be used to read books.",[]
"I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N;, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.",[]
"So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.",[]
You have no access to them if you don't use their products!,[]
"Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.",[]
"However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.",[]
; If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook.,[]
It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!,[]
Really a nasty way to do business.,[]
Amazon is different.,[]
"Once you buy a book, it is yours.",[]
You can read it on any device.,[]
"When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.",[]
"The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.",[]
There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable.,[]
"Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.",[]
"You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.",[]
"You try it again, and still nothing.",[]
What a joke.,[]
"Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.",[]
I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.,[]
I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.,[]
"If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.",[]
"Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.",[]
"If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.",[]
This happens several times an hour.,[]
"You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap.",[]
"Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable.",[]
"The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!",[]
It is thinner and wider.,[]
You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.,[]
"You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.",[]
"So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck.",[]
"Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!",[]
Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.,[]
"Excelent choice on a e-book reader small, light, and clear to read any book!",[]
I fully recommend this e-book for gift or personal,[]
"I had some issues first learning it, but now I love my NOOK!!",[]
I am very happy with this purchase.,[]
"A wonderful e-book - very easy navigation, high-quality screen, accurate assembly.",[]
"Ekpluatiroval until not long, I hope that in time NOOK fails.",[]
"Easy to use, good battery, no need additional soft, only Calibre to convert e-books.Just need correct device firmware interface, to make it more useful:- Remember last 5 Read now books.",[]
"(Not 1, because e-reader can use other friends/partners and read different books)- Remember each book stop reading page, if I restart book again.- Need slide toolbar for quick select directory, shelf  etc.",[]
"Works great , has more features than I thought it did and well worth the price I would buy again",[]
this is bad ... this reader in one month doesn't work !,[]
!Technical Support also very bad !,[]
!don't buy it,[]
"While I do love my Kindle, it can't do everything.",[]
"For instance, borrowing ebooks via my local library is a no-go if I want to read them on my Kindle.",[]
"So, with that and other reasons in mind, I looked for something cheap and reliable to read epub files.",[]
"I might have gone with the Kobo, but found the prices exorbitant--particularly on Amazon.",[]
"So a used Nook it is and in the week or so I've been trying it out, it works just as well as I had hoped.",[]
"In fact, the touch screen that allows swiping through the pages is a nice little feature that my humble Kindle just can't do.So I would say if you want a budget-priced ereader that's NOT a Kindle, this is a pretty darned good product to consider.",[]
I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes:I used to have a Kindle 3.,[]
It was great.,[]
It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change.,[]
I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like.,[]
"Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased.",[]
I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself.,[]
You can find that just about anywhere.,[]
What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier.,[]
I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it?,"[('fact', 0.14558070646708499)]"
?With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty).,[]
"Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of).",[]
I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen.,[]
Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app.,[]
"I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch.",[]
The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway.,[]
"Yes it has a web browser, email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device.",[]
That isn't why I did this.,[]
I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.I now have the best of both worlds.,[]
I gave this to my sister for Christmas who said it was the best thing she got this year.,[]
She loves it and the wall adapter I got for it.,[]
"Excellent price, excellent purchase.",[]
Next time I will buy it for myself.,[]
"If you only want to read, this is fine.",[]
"The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color.",[]
This model is only print and only black and white.,[]
This eReader is a total crap!,[]
You can't view detailed images and charts in it as it doesn't have a zoom functionality!,[]
this limits it's use to just pure-text ebooks.,[]
"This issue has been raised ever since it's released and yet B&N; has never released an update to make the functionality available.I really regret buying it, no wonder people are trying to sell them off pre-owned.",[]
"Buy a Kobo mini instead, at nearly the same price it has all the basic functionality you would need from an eReader.",[]
"Out of the box she knew how to operate it, and is working fine getting a lot of use as she likes reading.",[]
Glad to see as she is only 8 years old.Bill,[]
Barnes and Noble hit one out of the park with this ereader!,[]
"compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!","[('ereader', 0.03975304599203236), ('android', 0.030823589102625715)]"
"I love reading, and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didn't want to carry any heavy things.",[]
This is great!,[]
I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books!,[]
I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isn't very good.,[]
"I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary, which means it doesn't explain the word fully but still doesn't allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...",[]
i think it not good.,[]
The machine was taken apart.,[]
Because there is some crack in it.,[]
I don't like it.,[]
Only if you only want an ereader and don't want tablet functions to distract you while reading.,[]
I rooted mine to get bookstore variety and to read pdfs.,[]
Kicked up my reading.,[]
I'm Happy!,[]

"It's the best, if you are ready to do some reprogramming.",[]
Yoo can make it Android 2.1 device that can install anything from Market.,[]
"It makes Nook not just reader, but tablet-pc with e-mail, browser, games, etc.!",[]
Quality is good and touch works fine.,[]
I recently purchased the nook thinking it would be great for school.,[]
Most of my readings for class are pdf's that the professors post online.,[]
Reading on the computer screen hurts my eyes and it seems wasteful to print out all the pages.,[]
This seemed like the perfect solution.,[]
"However, the result was teeny tiny print on the screen that I was unable to enlarge because it wasn't the Barnes and Noble e-book format.",[]
"In addition, the capacity of the device is grossly overestimated.",[]
I have no idea how it is supposed to fit so many books if it couldn't even store 500 pages of pdf document for me.,[]
Definitely something to skip purchasing.,[]
Save your money.,[]
Bought this for my wife for my wife for Christmas and she uses it every day.,[]
"Already went through 22 books, most of them free through Barnes and Noble.",[]
A great buy and very happy it.,[]
"I think, the title sums up my opinion about this purchase good enough, but since I need to write 20+ words about it as well, here it goes.Putting some background, I don't have time nor money to purchase every book I want to read in paper, I find reading off the laptop screen impractical and uncomfortable because my laptop is too big to unsheathe it every time I want, while getting somewhere on a bus or a tram.","[('time', 0.13813879768802254)]"
"And I'm not rich enough to buy myself an iPad :DSo I was looking for a simple e-reader without bells & whistles, MP3, 3G, video playback capabilities and other stuff I won't use anyway, because I have an mp3 player for music, laptop for games, internet and movies, and I needed another piece of hardware to just read.","[('dso', 0.096633526209691)]"
"Yeah, I'm all for ""divide and conquer"" and don't like combining everything in one :)Getting to the point - this device is just what I wanted.",[]
"Text quality is great: ""paper"" is almost white, letters are black, just what I expected form the latest generation e-ink.",[]
The screen itslef barely blinks even without any kind of special protection (of course if you don't try to put it right under the lightbulb).,[]
"Page-turning buttons could be a little easier to press (that's why I gave it 4 stars in ""controls""), but who needs buttons, when you have a touchscreen anyway?What else?",[]
"Well, controls are easy to learn, but in case you forget something, the user guide is already inside as your first available book.",[]
"Easy to hold in hands, however I recommend you to buy a protective case for it to make your reading even easier and more comfortable.",[]
Requires wi-fi internet (b/g not n!),[]
