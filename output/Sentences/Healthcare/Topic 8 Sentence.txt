But do people who don't drive recklessly ask for money back when roads are damaged?

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

What we need is to get government out of our wallets so people can have their own money needed to purchase and own their own health insurance."'

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."'

These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.'

As most people know, most doctor's visits end with "take this and call me if it doesn't get better" which should hardly be seen as "preventative" of anything.'

Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Just as Americans donxd5t turn people away from hospital emergency rooms, Americans donxd5t leave people behind when it comes to health care insurance."'

How about this...If you don't want to help people who need medical care, then don't become a doctor.

I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education?

In the end, therefore, a public plan may leave more people without insurance, employer-provided or otherwise.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

However, the rest of your argument I believe is false.UHC would not benefit the majority of people.

The more qualified people will want to get paid what they're worth.I would hope that people would be more likely to see a doctor for preventative care but I do not believe this will happen.

AKA capitalism benefits the majority of people (and that's the best we can hope for)."

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

The denial of these rights by the people who control them have led to revolution after revolution... some violent and some more of an   evolution   than a revolution.

(This is exactly what's happened in education, people are fleeing public schools to private schools and home schools, and teachers unions have opposed those options too).

Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance.

Private companies reduce their risk by disqualifying people that exhibit risk.

This is not an issue of whether or not we let people die.

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

It is equally absurd to believe that all 50 million of these people living in the United States can be helped by "charity work."

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

It's a lie aimed at a specific group of people to get them riled against the bill.3.

The people who don't want it are the Republicans who think the Gov't is only good for: War, being a thing that is unwanted and over all useless.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

A government is not truly doing its job if it is not taking care of its people."

I agree, but I'm also wondering what people think needs to improve?

Man, it's the government's job to protect the people.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

So, if the government gives people health care, what does the government have to take?

It will not help the people.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Most people believe that the Constitution does in fact give the government the right to impose social programs.

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

Huge assumption but you can tell by the way people present their cases.

Actually, most educated people in the US agree with the universal option.	1	0.9027591943740845

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

There are 30 million people in Canada and this is the reason why Canada is not as prosperous as other capitalist countries.

People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better.

I say this because the people in the poverty line can not afford health care.

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor.

The government should not create a health care system that is aimed primarily at helping the poor and uninsured.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

June 11, 2009: "Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance.

IT investments do not require government intervention.

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

For example, governments, such as Canada, have outlawed medical care if the service is paid for by private individual funds.'

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

June 27, 2009: "Which raises the question: Would the existence of a dominant government provider of health insurance be good or bad?

The alternative to a government-controlled health care database is only a privately owned health care databases.

With these choices in mind, it is better that health care information be held by the government than by less-regulated companies.

Unless, they are fat, old, smoke, or are part of some other segment that is considered expendable to the government's balance sheets.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

June 11, 2009: "the public option puts government firmly in the middle of the relationship between patients and their doctors.

Will expensive bureaucratic government employees be more efficient than less expensive private insurance employees?

It's true that some doctors and dentists will choose not to participate in a government-run plan.

I certainly wouldn't say that "more government funding will fix the problem."

Most people believe that the Constitution does in fact give the government the right to impose social programs.

However, the federal government must use Article 1, Section 8 to derive their powers.

UHC is as expensive as the government lets it be.

Finally, because the government sets the prices, inventors and manufacturers of medical equipment will just fade away.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

The army of lobbyists includes 350 former government staff members who - before they took the revolving door for a spin - worked for the very same committees that are writing the legislation."'

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Doctors and nurses shouldn't work for free, the government should pay them, we should not have to.

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

Huge assumption but you can tell by the way people present their cases.

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

It is equally absurd to believe that all 50 million of these people living in the United States can be helped by "charity work."

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

In this country, if you have no money, you don't get a good insurance plan which is not fair.

The country would either take more and more of its citizen's money, or become trillions and trillions more dollars in debt."

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

When you figure in the added premium, they donxd5t save money.

I mean when you don't have insurance and you have to go to the hospital for any type of surgery or more than a "doctor visitation" the cost really hurts those who do not have a lot of money.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Health care is a basic human right or entitlement Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights.

This is why health must be considered a basic human right.'

If citizens have a right to be healthy, they are due some protections from the sickly.

Health care is considered a right in international law.

The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights enumerates medical care as a universal right.'

If there is a conflict between life and money life should prevail because it is a right while money is a want not a need. '

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Securing one right by impeding on other is illegitimate.'

Whether health care is a right under i-law is inconsequential.

People have a right to pay more for better health care Froma Harrop.

A right to health care is not necessary in taking care of sick patients.

Costs are inconsequential if health care is considered a universal right.

Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.'

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

The flawed premise behind "universal health care" is regarding health care as a "right".

Health care is a need, but not a "right", and that's a critical difference.

It's definitely true that no one has a right to healthcare since this would require enslaving someone else to give it to them.

Under this reasoning, a person who comes into the ER is violating a Dr's rights because they owe them a care of duty at this point.

I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

Health care is not a right.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. '

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

The question is: 'Why should policymakers give private insurers the exclusive right to cover Americans?

I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a "right.

Some would argue that health care is a right.

You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare.

Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.

A "right" can never include violating someone else's rights.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

The denial of these rights by the people who control them have led to revolution after revolution... some violent and some more of an   evolution   than a revolution.

Those rights are possessed equally, at all times, by all people, under all circumstances, protected equally by government; they can be forfeited only by violating the same rights of another.

And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing "imposed" on them is that they not violate my rights.

I agree, but I'm also wondering what people think needs to improve?

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

The more qualified people will want to get paid what they're worth.I would hope that people would be more likely to see a doctor for preventative care but I do not believe this will happen.

I go in with any problem, and I can get in to see a doctor within an hour.

They couldn't go see a doctor."

America has more malpractice suits than any other country, which means that our doctors need to be heavily insured.

While this won't rule out malpractice 100% there will always be the doctor who makes a mistake.

If we expand that policy to cover every doctor and every procedure we will have several negative results.

In some parts of Canada, the wait to see a doctor for a routine exam is two years.

For a typical year, the family of four would probably have six visits to the doctor.

I mean when you don't have insurance and you have to go to the hospital for any type of surgery or more than a "doctor visitation" the cost really hurts those who do not have a lot of money.

Plus, there are copays for the doctor and prescription.

The NHS produces doctors who will see you quicker if you are registered to BUPA.

And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).

The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).

Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided. '

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

Society should strive to defend and care for the needy and vulnerable, instead of subjecting them to a system that punishes them for their disadvantages.'

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

Many uninsured are lazy free-loaders who don't deserve care Many uninsured are simply lazy, and believe they can get a free ride off of the system.

The government should not create a health care system that is aimed primarily at helping the poor and uninsured.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Without an alternative, the monopolistic system becomes an "uncontested standard" that may be inferior."'

Public health care is good; it just receives more scrutiny/criticism Public health care systems receive more scrutiny by the public because they are publicly accountable.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

Universal health care risks monopsony: Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.'

Universal health care internationally is better than US system Paul Krugman, Robin Wells.

Any proposal to shift to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry.

Most doctor's offices maintain a separate record-keeping system.

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

GDP is a GROSS measurement, and as seen in the above article Canadian systems SPEND less than US systems yet this doesn't even prevent them from COSTING less.	0	1.3387318176683038E-4

If private insurers can better meet our goals for the health system, why object to a level competition with public plans?'"'

Why should we avoid a system, the free market, when it has worked  in every where else?

Don't confuse a free market system with a charity free system and don't confuse a socialist system with a free charity system.

Greed is the main motivator for both actions so do not listen to the lies see the movie and listen to the real people that have nothing to gain by lying about the system.

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

You also know I'm correct... but to do so would be to acknowledge to you small mind that perhaps the system we've been operating under doesn't work so hot.

Public option is really about making way for a single-payer system Gregory Mankiw.

During the presidential campaign, he said, 'If I were designing a system from scratch, I would probably go ahead with a single-payer system.'"'

Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?

Hospitals that operate for profit doctors the AMA insurance companies they are all getting rich the way it is and we are stuck with this system that we have.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

I may not be thrilled with the expense of my current PPO plan, but it's a MILLION times better than what I experienced in the military system. "

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

I'm a Viet Nam vet currently on my wife's insurance, so I'm happy with the system as long as my wife keeps her job.

I wouldn't want anyone to feel they were "drafted" into a health insurance system that they didn't want.

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

If you oppose Universal Healthcare, what about the current system do you think works well?

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

June 6, 2009: "The ONLY reason there is consideration of continuing the failed, greedy, destructive corporate insurance system is because the few who get rich off of it are paying off politicians to keep things they way they are.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

Universal health care holds some individuals accountable for the actions of others.    '

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

The benefits are far to diverse to pigeon-hole universal health care as just "welfare".'

Many uninsured are lazy free-loaders who don't deserve care Many uninsured are simply lazy, and believe they can get a free ride off of the system.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

Universal health care will cut physician cash-flow and disrupt living-standards.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

Government has a cost incentive to invest in preventive care Paul Krugman, Robin Wells.

Better technologies and treatments in private health care aids prevention.

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

Universal health care, therefore, could be expected to see fewer innovations and medical advancements.  '

Universal health care creates a universal standard of care Nathan Newman.

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

Canada's the wrong model for universal health care.

Public health care is good; it just receives more scrutiny/criticism Public health care systems receive more scrutiny by the public because they are publicly accountable.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

Costs are inconsequential if health care is considered a universal right.

Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.'

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

Therefore, in countries where the population is aging, it may be important to avoid a universal health care program."

Universal health care reduces administrative costs (i.e.

paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.

Universal health care internationally is better than US system Paul Krugman, Robin Wells.

Millions don't have health insurance in US; universal health care would address this "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?".

Obamacare to Come: Seven Bad Ideas for Health Care Reform'

The flawed premise behind "universal health care" is regarding health care as a "right".

Health care is a need, but not a "right", and that's a critical difference.

This is why "universal health care" is such a grossly immoral policy, and should be opposed as such.'

It's definitely true that no one has a right to healthcare since this would require enslaving someone else to give it to them.

Under this reasoning, a person who comes into the ER is violating a Dr's rights because they owe them a care of duty at this point.

How about this...If you don't want to help people who need medical care, then don't become a doctor.

I think healthcare for all is a worthwhile goal.

I want Universal healthcare, but I think it needs to be private.'

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

Health care is not a right.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. '

If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.

Some would argue that health care is a right.

I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare.

Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care.

If you have more money you can get better insurance so someone that earns alot of money should be able to pay for better heatlh care then some bum off the streets.'

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

)Forcing someone else to pay someone else to take care of you is not a right.

Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?"

Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.

Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.

Will increase supplemental insurance premiums for privatized care?

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

And for those who have a hard time getting insurance into taking better care of themselves with regular checkups.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected?

The more qualified people will want to get paid what they're worth.I would hope that people would be more likely to see a doctor for preventative care but I do not believe this will happen.

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

The cost of   health care  .

Why do you believe a company out to make a buck is more likely to take better care of you than the government?

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.

You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you.

You apparently have no problems unless it involves the words "health care".

We are not   animals   because we can take care of ourselves (I can anyway).

I used to process Medicare insurance claims, what a joke.

- And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.

If it is all Universal Healthcare paid by the Government, you will see a flood of   doctors   stop practicing, it will no longer be profitable and full of regulations.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?

We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well.

there was never a questino regarding abortion or welfare or 'universal healthcare'i just would remind all Americans that " He who can regulate a thing, controls that thing".

Be careful what you wish for!'

We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy. "

Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens?

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

This affects both private and public healthcare.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

I don't think military structured health care is an equitable comparison.

Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Don't worry, I'm sure there are many visions for universal   health care   in this country.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses.

And a public insurance plan will invest in health care in our communities."'

They are going to take money away from Medicare:Ignoring that Medicare is a government program and the naysayers should be all for taking money away from medicare - if they were basing their arguements on principle at least - this is not true either.

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff.

Move to Cuba haaaaa....How about this, If America is the greatest country they should have the best Health care.

if anyone can give all their citizans proper health care its the USA.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

Illegal immigrants wound not get the health care because you have to show proof you are a US citizen.

Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money.

Exactly who are you referring to that you don't want to have healthcare sir?'

A government is not truly doing its job if it is not taking care of its people."

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Ergo, that is why the proposed legislation of Healthcare reform is so hotly debated in the US.

Every European I have met scoffs and is incredulous that we have no universal healthcare and that we pay for university.

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible.

Universal healthcare presents an opportunity for the health of all it's citizens.

So, if the government gives people health care, what does the government have to take?

If they provide reduced care (see Canada, Australia, France, Great Britain...) then they can do it for less.

The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Universal healthcare is not a band-aid, so why should it be treated as such?

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

The Government doesn't own us, so therefore it shouldn't have to take care of us like our mother did.'

Using the soviet union isn't the best example, especially when you didn't even note anything on health care policy.

What about all the countries that have universal health care now?

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.
