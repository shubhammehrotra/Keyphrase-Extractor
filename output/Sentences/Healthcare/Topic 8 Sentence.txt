This is a highly disruptive act that would involve massive job loss.

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

Quality of health care is much worse under universal health care.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor.

Well I'm glad you have done so, what you get from unemployment is less that 50% of your total monthly income when you were employed and this is on top of not receiving insurance.

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

Most doctor's offices maintain a separate record-keeping system.

But even if a public option available to all takes the highly improbable step of paying at some midpoint between private and Medicare rates, nearly 68 million people will still be crowded out of private insurance."'

For a typical year, the family of four would probably have six visits to the doctor.

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

This should add another 3-4% onto our economic growth a year.Along with my trade reforms we could have 10% economic growth year over year.

The potential growth in the GDP could absorb the absurd debt we are forced into.As for the draft.

But if what they say about it is wrong then we will go deeper into debt and a bigger recession.

The country would either take more and more of its citizen's money, or become trillions and trillions more dollars in debt."

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

Universal health care would amount to welfare for the uninsured.

paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

I feel a great amount of sympathy for you that our nation enslaved you for two years.

Individuals and families earning less than these amounts will be eligible for subsidies paid directly to their insurer.xd3This is absolute crap.

Take Sweden for example, where a person can walk into a hospital at any moment and get treated without the gratuitous amount of paperwork, or questions like, "Who's your insurance carrier?

In addition, Ixd5d allow them to put their excess HSA savings in bonds and cds so that they earn a small amount of interest with virtually no chance of loss.

This cost-shifting amounts to a forced subsidy.

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?"

Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.

Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided. '

For instance - would it be equal if no one had access to MRI's?

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Those rights are possessed equally, at all times, by all people, under all circumstances, protected equally by government; they can be forfeited only by violating the same rights of another.

You are saying they are not the human equals of yourself.

It is equally absurd to believe that all 50 million of these people living in the United States can be helped by "charity work."

Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?'

Certainly, healthcare isn't an equal right if some are paying for themselves and others, and others are contributing nothing.'

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.

Let Darwin be Darwin and soon we'll only have the lower middle class to worry about.

And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all.

The middle class will bear more weight (and taxation) upon their shoulders.

The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

50 Gs is enough to put middle or lower class person into debt with ease.

Increasing competition between insurance companies will force them to reduce spending and maximize customer base.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

It takes out the motive to keep spending down.

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

Again, the worse the actual performance, the better Medicare's administrative costs appear as a percentage of total spending."'

By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance.

paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.

/> We can eliminate wasteful inefficiencies such as duplicate paper work, claim approval, insurance submission, etc.

Tyrants, "social justice" totalitarians, humanitarians with a "good cause" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough.

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

Morris:xca And what's going to happen is the same thing that goes on in Canada.xca Because of the long wait for colonoscopies, the incidence of colon   cancer   in Canada is 25 percent higher than in the US.And because the two top drugs we use for chemotherapy for advanced stage colon cancer are not available in Canada because of costs, the death rate is 2 % higher.xca 41 percent of Canadians die of colon cancer compared to 32 in the US.O'Reilly:xca That is one of the most compelling things about your book, is that you deliver statistics that say Americans are a lot healthier than Canadians are in the vital disease categoryxd1heart disease, cancer, things like that.xcaMorris:xca Let's quantify it.xca 6 percent lower death rate from heart disease and a 16 percent lower death rate from cancer in the US.xca And Canada has more poor people.	0	9.736777865327895E-4

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you.

Will expensive bureaucratic government employees be more efficient than less expensive private insurance employees?

--Milton.Dictionary.com defines the term general:1. of or pertaining to all persons or things belonging to a group or category: a general meeting of the employees.

Just look at what has happened with Medicare.'

It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.

For example look at the wonderful job they do with FEMA.

Many lessons learned can be obtained if we take a deeper look at the   evolution   of the NHS in the UK.

look at it this way, alot of people are dying because they cant afford medical insurance or that they have another helth issue going on.

Looking out for your neighbor means that he will look out for you... and if he doesn't, the guy on the other side will.

Provided you're not a complete douche (which is the point of why it's not altruism to look out for your neighbor, but is actually done in self-interest).

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

We only have to look here in our own country to see evidence of that.

Do you really doubt that medical care is NOT superior in the US than in other countries?

And for that matter, is money really the most important consideration?

Greed is the main motivator for both actions so do not listen to the lies see the movie and listen to the real people that have nothing to gain by lying about the system.

Okay.Health Care is really, really important.

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

not really, because all those people are under the thumb of those who make OTHERS work harder while they receive more compensation.

Public option is really about making way for a single-payer system Gregory Mankiw.

And it's a real shame.'

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

Do you really want tomorrow's limitation...bureaucracy?

This, in my personal view is what a good government should really aim to do."

I mean when you don't have insurance and you have to go to the hospital for any type of surgery or more than a "doctor visitation" the cost really hurts those who do not have a lot of money.

The myth that "bipartisan" legislation works better than partisan legislation is widespread, but virtually no real evidence supports it.

Public insurance meets moral obligation to insure the uninsured Ronald R. Mercer, Bullhead City, Ariz. "America, its uninsured need public option".

As for a moral obligation - we have already, as a society, decided it is best for eeryone if we pay for every child's education.

Universal health care is a social good, not merely an economic good Universal health care generally decreases human misery and increases human welfare.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

The benefits are far to diverse to pigeon-hole universal health care as just "welfare".'

Universal health care would amount to welfare for the uninsured.

So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. '

there was never a questino regarding abortion or welfare or 'universal healthcare'i just would remind all Americans that " He who can regulate a thing, controls that thing".

Promoting general welfare would involve more than simply making sure the law/regulations we put in place do 'not harm the country.'"Seriously?

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

;)I do not say that I exist on my own, or that society is evil, those are your words, nor do I claim that I don't benefit from cooperating with others in society, so all your sarcasm against those positions is misdirected.

Either you should be opposed to fire/police protection and universal healthcare, or should support both.

Do you have to earn protection from the   police   or the fire department?

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

If a police officer is near you while you are being attacked, he will obviously intervene because it is his duty.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

The right to not be murdered requires policemen, police stations, and taxes to pay for them.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

But even if a public option available to all takes the highly improbable step of paying at some midpoint between private and Medicare rates, nearly 68 million people will still be crowded out of private insurance."'

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

Health care is not a right.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

If USA needs change, it is for free market heathcare...eliminate the government interfere we already have and we'll see change for the better.   "

Do you really doubt that medical care is NOT superior in the US than in other countries?

Here kid, learn some math, but good luck taking care of that asthma problem you have.

Be careful what you wish for, or you may kill us all off and have no one to run your cash registers and maintain your road medians.'

You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. '

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a "right.

So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. '

If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.

Some would argue that health care is a right.

I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare.

Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care.

If you have more money you can get better insurance so someone that earns alot of money should be able to pay for better heatlh care then some bum off the streets.'

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

)Forcing someone else to pay someone else to take care of you is not a right.

Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?"

Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.

Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.

Will increase supplemental insurance premiums for privatized care?

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

And for those who have a hard time getting insurance into taking better care of themselves with regular checkups.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected?

The more qualified people will want to get paid what they're worth.I would hope that people would be more likely to see a doctor for preventative care but I do not believe this will happen.

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

The cost of   health care  .

Why do you believe a company out to make a buck is more likely to take better care of you than the government?

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.

You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you.

You apparently have no problems unless it involves the words "health care".

We are not   animals   because we can take care of ourselves (I can anyway).

I used to process Medicare insurance claims, what a joke.

- And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.

If it is all Universal Healthcare paid by the Government, you will see a flood of   doctors   stop practicing, it will no longer be profitable and full of regulations.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?

We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well.

there was never a questino regarding abortion or welfare or 'universal healthcare'i just would remind all Americans that " He who can regulate a thing, controls that thing".

Be careful what you wish for!'

We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy. "

Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens?

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

This affects both private and public healthcare.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

I don't think military structured health care is an equitable comparison.

Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Don't worry, I'm sure there are many visions for universal   health care   in this country.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses.

And a public insurance plan will invest in health care in our communities."'

They are going to take money away from Medicare:Ignoring that Medicare is a government program and the naysayers should be all for taking money away from medicare - if they were basing their arguements on principle at least - this is not true either.

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff.

Move to Cuba haaaaa....How about this, If America is the greatest country they should have the best Health care.

if anyone can give all their citizans proper health care its the USA.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

Illegal immigrants wound not get the health care because you have to show proof you are a US citizen.

Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money.

Exactly who are you referring to that you don't want to have healthcare sir?'

A government is not truly doing its job if it is not taking care of its people."

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Ergo, that is why the proposed legislation of Healthcare reform is so hotly debated in the US.

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible.

Universal healthcare presents an opportunity for the health of all it's citizens.

So, if the government gives people health care, what does the government have to take?

If they provide reduced care (see Canada, Australia, France, Great Britain...) then they can do it for less.

The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Universal healthcare is not a band-aid, so why should it be treated as such?

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

Using the soviet union isn't the best example, especially when you didn't even note anything on health care policy.

What about all the countries that have universal health care now?

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Reducing profit, reduces motive and the money necessary to get a drug through FDA trials.

A universal health plan means the entire health insurance industry would be unnecessary.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

It isn't altruism.. it was necessary for survival.

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

If you make it to 18, we might have some jobs for you, thanks to your high school diploma.Cuba has better infant and maternal mortality rates than us, for Pete's sake.

Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?

(This is exactly what's happened in education, people are fleeing public schools to private schools and home schools, and teachers unions have opposed those options too).

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

So I used the same model in to model my Health Care Plan around.We recruit kids out of high school, that have good grades and a interest in the medical field, but because of financial reasons cannot afford to go to College.

I also advocate for plans like MassHealth.

Of course if my wife gets laid off like a few dozen of her co-workers did last week, then I'm totally screwed.

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.

Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

However, the rest of your argument I believe is false.UHC would not benefit the majority of people.

AKA capitalism benefits the majority of people (and that's the best we can hope for)."

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

For example, would "elective" surgeries such as breast implants, wart removal, hair restoration, and lasik eye surgery be covered?

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

1274	Stealing   money   from some people (while calling it taxation") to pay for the medical expenses of others in still wrong.

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

Small businesses can survive for they do not need to pay expensive medical insurance, & can hire more people, more income   taxes  , more buyer of goods, thus, envigorating the economy'

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor.

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

So if we added all of that stuff onto what you pay in taxes, you'd find that you actually don't pay as much for what you get as a french person does.Now, you can argue against UHC on two fronts, it seems to me.

I'd like to have   health insurance   that I didn't have to ask each time to make sure what part they were going to pay."

It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system.

Yes, this is because they have more money, but don't you want your employer to have more money than you so they can afford to pay you?

They will end up paying less percentage wise than their secretaries...   and they'll even admit it.

You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you.

If that doesn't pay enough, I will strive to be a research director for a biomedical   technology   company to design and test biomedical devices to increase the quality of life for many people.

Public option is really about making way for a single-payer system Gregory Mankiw.

During the presidential campaign, he said, 'If I were designing a system from scratch, I would probably go ahead with a single-payer system.'"'

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims.

When a hospital writes off a bill who pays?

Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance.

Such breaches of the individual liberties of taxpayers are unjust."

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

The right to not be murdered requires policemen, police stations, and taxes to pay for them.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

224 (p. 118) provides that 18 months after the bill becomes law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what a "qualified plan" covers and how much you'll be legally required to pay for it.

That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.xd3You pay a tax to support a service.

The Institute for America's Future: "over the last generation, public insurance has pioneered new payment and quality-improvement methods that have frequently set the standard for private plans.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Every European I have met scoffs and is incredulous that we have no universal healthcare and that we pay for university.

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

They can't pay for the surgery, so they're screwed.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4.

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible.

The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

If they are on the Cigna plan, they will pay a $30 deductible per visit plus 20% which comes to $324.

June 6, 2009: "The ONLY reason there is consideration of continuing the failed, greedy, destructive corporate insurance system is because the few who get rich off of it are paying off politicians to keep things they way they are.

They then either spend years struggling trying to pay it off or they just can't pay it and it ruins their credit etc.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

Canada actually pays 40% more taxes."

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Yes after an initial payment of lets say a pound or two per visit.'

Doctors and nurses shouldn't work for free, the government should pay them, we should not have to.

Plus, there are copays for the doctor and prescription.

It is not my obligation to pay for the healthcare of others.

As a Christian, I am all for charity and think the church needs to step up to that far better than it has done so, but forced payment on my part removes that possibility.

3716	Why critics of a public option for healthcare are wrong".

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

However, any costs not covered by insurance must be absorbed by all the rest of us, which means even higher premiums."'

Will increase supplemental insurance premiums for privatized care?

This would enable them to charge lower premiums.

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

April 13, 2009: "As people gravitate to 'free' or heavily subsidized care, the inevitably explosive costs will be covered in part with increased outlays to keep premiums artificially low or even offer extra benefits.

I may not be thrilled with the expense of my current PPO plan, but it's a MILLION times better than what I experienced in the military system. "

I don't think military structured health care is an equitable comparison.

Have you been given control of the lives of your local police officers?Along the same lines, are you "enslaving" the military, who provides your national defense?

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/us/04pharmacy.html?ref=todayspaper  Yes, you can go to an emergency room no matter what.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  So what's being talked about right now isn't that as much as it is a heavily regulated new system of private insurance companies.

It's a lie aimed at a specific group of people to get them riled against the bill.3.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.'

But, what is likely to make the most money is often at odds with public and patient interests. '

Whatxd5s interesting here is that you would actually use the example of public education to justify socialized medicine.

It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.

I'm interested to hear how you define "corrupted" in reference to government.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

Provided you're not a complete douche (which is the point of why it's not altruism to look out for your neighbor, but is actually done in self-interest).

We must put special interests aside and help our citizens.Health Care is a right.

That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.xd3You pay a tax to support a service.

One of the interesting things that popped out to me was the projected deficit increase in billions.

So I used the same model in to model my Health Care Plan around.We recruit kids out of high school, that have good grades and a interest in the medical field, but because of financial reasons cannot afford to go to College.

In addition, Ixd5d allow them to put their excess HSA savings in bonds and cds so that they earn a small amount of interest with virtually no chance of loss.

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

Health care is a basic human right or entitlement Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights.

This is why health must be considered a basic human right.'

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

I suppose I disagree "with one of the most basic declarations of human rights."

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

Major Medical covers some very basic health issues.

And, of course, one cannot pursue happiness if they are in a hospital bed.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

Each individual can choose their own path to pursue happiness because nobody's path is the same.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

They choose not to get it for reasons other than their means (i.e., their laziness). '

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

You see, when you are free, you control your life...which means you are not at anyonexd5s mercy.

I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor.

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Looking out for your neighbor means that he will look out for you... and if he doesn't, the guy on the other side will.

The right to life means nobody else can   murder   you.

That means we already spend more per person than France, Canada or the UK does... in fact, only Germany and Iceland spend more per person than the United States when it comes to public funding.

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

America has more malpractice suits than any other country, which means that our doctors need to be heavily insured.

I said everywhere, that means you could have picked any country any where and made the case that this country is the reason we need UHC.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

First you start with a dishonest heading: "Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System" Then you admit within the first couple of sentences that the title is nonsense.

And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all.

Have you been given control of the lives of your local police officers?Along the same lines, are you "enslaving" the military, who provides your national defense?

Our post offices used to be part of a great bureaucracy; now the local post office appears to be run as franchised businesses.

Let Darwin be Darwin and soon we'll only have the lower middle class to worry about.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

Whether universal health care is a legitimate "burden" on the tax payer should be considered inconsequential.

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor.

It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system.

Public option is really about making way for a single-payer system Gregory Mankiw.

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

But in our judgment, if that many Americans were to decide that such a plan is a better deal for them and their families, that would be a good thing.

Individuals and families earning less than these amounts will be eligible for subsidies paid directly to their insurer.xd3This is absolute crap.

Just as Americans donxd5t turn people away from hospital emergency rooms, Americans donxd5t leave people behind when it comes to health care insurance."'

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

If you are aware and read you know our so-called leaders senate/house lie to us and waste our money and vote with the corporations that pay them through PACs (political action committees) having said that here is my plan.

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

Tyrants, "social justice" totalitarians, humanitarians with a "good cause" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough.

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

The public plan would be subject to all sorts of political interventions and would be required to delay making changes in health plans until it had solicited extensive public comments.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Health care is a basic human right or entitlement Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights.

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Better technologies and treatments in private health care aids prevention.

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness.

For those that will contract illnesses or cancers regardless of any preventative measures they take, such high-end treatment is welcome. "

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

Universal health care, therefore, could be expected to see fewer innovations and medical advancements.  '

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

Government may set one standard of health care, but it may be inferior.

For example, governments, such as Canada, have outlawed medical care if the service is paid for by private individual funds.'

With these choices in mind, it is better that health care information be held by the government than by less-regulated companies.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

Unless, they are fat, old, smoke, or are part of some other segment that is considered expendable to the government's balance sheets.

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a "right.

To believe in my plan you should first watch the documentary SICKO by Roger Moore.

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

Do you have to earn protection from the   police   or the fire department?

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

Will increase supplemental insurance premiums for privatized care?

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

However, the rest of your argument I believe is false.UHC would not benefit the majority of people.

It won't matter if they skip an appointment, they're covered if something bad happens.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

But in our judgment, if that many Americans were to decide that such a plan is a better deal for them and their families, that would be a good thing.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

I'm interested to hear how you define "corrupted" in reference to government.

Why do you believe a company out to make a buck is more likely to take better care of you than the government?

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

There will be waiting lines, there will be rationing, there will be monumental incompetence and arrogant bureaucracy.

So you also hold the view that the most powerful weapon corrupt corporations have is government regulation, bailouts, etc.	0	0.0017723797354847193

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Those rights are possessed equally, at all times, by all people, under all circumstances, protected equally by government; they can be forfeited only by violating the same rights of another.

True conservatism does not hate government.

That's all..... and it's a very easy argument to make and a hard one to argue against.

As for everything else in your comment, you've lost me.

If it is all Universal Healthcare paid by the Government, you will see a flood of   doctors   stop practicing, it will no longer be profitable and full of regulations.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

Will expensive bureaucratic government employees be more efficient than less expensive private insurance employees?

Socialized medicine is a complete disaster all around the world, the more thorough the implementation the more disastarous the results.

It's true that some doctors and dentists will choose not to participate in a government-run plan.

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

I certainly wouldn't say that "more government funding will fix the problem."

Their governments have simply made an arbitrary decision to spend less, but they will also get less."

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

The right to not be murdered requires policemen, police stations, and taxes to pay for them.

I suggest you review the fundamental right to life, and the derivative rights liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness.

And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing "imposed" on them is that they not violate my rights.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Police officers are a requirement, Ambulance drivers are a necessity, Fire Departments are an essential service all funded by public money.

They are going to take money away from Medicare:Ignoring that Medicare is a government program and the naysayers should be all for taking money away from medicare - if they were basing their arguements on principle at least - this is not true either.

The Institute for America's Future: "over the last generation, public insurance has pioneered new payment and quality-improvement methods that have frequently set the standard for private plans.

Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money.

The public plan would be subject to all sorts of political interventions and would be required to delay making changes in health plans until it had solicited extensive public comments.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

(a) In General- Subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new part:`PART VIII--HEALTH CARE RELATED TAXES`subpart a. tax on individuals without acceptable health care coverage.`Subpart A--Tax on Individuals Without Acceptable Health Care Coverage`Sec.

And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all.

Take Sweden for example, where a person can walk into a hospital at any moment and get treated without the gratuitous amount of paperwork, or questions like, "Who's your insurance carrier?

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

Man, it's the government's job to protect the people.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Sorry boss, I couldn't find anything our government does well.

We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4.

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible.

This, in my personal view is what a good government should really aim to do."

So, if the government gives people health care, what does the government have to take?

The government will also take freedom.

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Doctors do what they do for the money, especially the good ones.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

The markets are better at providing quality; same with health care.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

Will require new Government protocols, regulation and mandates set up by bureaucrats, lacking medical credentials?

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

Indications from the Medicare Advantage experience suggest that, if anything, private plans would most likely be favored over a public plan.

For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009)."'

Society should strive to defend and care for the needy and vulnerable, instead of subjecting them to a system that punishes them for their disadvantages.'

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.

Rather should we develop a minimal health coverage that all should have.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.

Second, this strategy would encourage patients to use appropriate generic drugs.

Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

Health coverage would cost more for unhealthier people.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

If our primary business competitors (excepting China) have   health   coverage for all, why don't we?

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

1483	There are two possibilities here.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

Some countries already have this and they dont know why we are stuck in the stone age.

(hence why i say them) But nice usage of my little ass umption ;) As to your second point.
