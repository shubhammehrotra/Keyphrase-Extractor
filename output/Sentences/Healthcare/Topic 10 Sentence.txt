The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor.

Indications from the Medicare Advantage experience suggest that, if anything, private plans would most likely be favored over a public plan.

Socializing anything involves taking individual decisions and "socializing" any negative effects to the community instead of limiting it to the individual.'

I don't have a link for this, but if you doubt me please go to an ER and ask for a colonoscopy or a mammogram.The American Cancer Society found that (and this is sort of a duh thing)   cancer   kills more often if you don't have adequate health insurance.

Morris:xca And what's going to happen is the same thing that goes on in Canada.xca Because of the long wait for colonoscopies, the incidence of colon   cancer   in Canada is 25 percent higher than in the US.And because the two top drugs we use for chemotherapy for advanced stage colon cancer are not available in Canada because of costs, the death rate is 2 % higher.xca 41 percent of Canadians die of colon cancer compared to 32 in the US.O'Reilly:xca That is one of the most compelling things about your book, is that you deliver statistics that say Americans are a lot healthier than Canadians are in the vital disease categoryxd1heart disease, cancer, things like that.xcaMorris:xca Let's quantify it.xca 6 percent lower death rate from heart disease and a 16 percent lower death rate from cancer in the US.xca And Canada has more poor people.	0	9.736777865327895E-4

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Sorry boss, I couldn't find anything our government does well.

Do you want to be FORCED to get something done just cause the government papers says you should.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

Private companies reduce their risk by disqualifying people that exhibit risk.

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.

[...] The mission of health insurance companies is a healthy bottom line, not your health.

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

You have pharma companies charging an arm and a leg for products that aren't worth the price.

The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

And insurance companies will continue to profit by discriminating against sick people."'

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage.

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.

Rather should we develop a minimal health coverage that all should have.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.

Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

Health coverage would cost more for unhealthier people.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

If our primary business competitors (excepting China) have   health   coverage for all, why don't we?

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

http://select.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/opinion/21kristof.html?scp=5&sq=kristof  +infant+mortality+rate&st=nyt18,000 Americans die every year because of a lack of   health   coverage.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

On top of that, children aren't getting the coverage they need.

There's bipartisan support for subsidies and health exchanges to assure portable, affordable coverage.

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

Universal health care is wrongheaded to the extent that it involves protecting individuals from themselves. '

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

Universal health care holds some individuals accountable for the actions of others.    '

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Productive individuals are what makes a country great.'

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?"

Using it as an argument fails as it's only an appeal to authority."

Most uninsured simply can't afford it; it's not a choice Kao-Ping Chua, "Arguments and counterarguments about universal health care".

If that argument holds water for you then I'd suggest reading up the utilitarian arguments for capitalism and the free market."

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a "right.

However, the rest of your argument I believe is false.UHC would not benefit the majority of people.

That's all..... and it's a very easy argument to make and a hard one to argue against.

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

As for a moral obligation - we have already, as a society, decided it is best for eeryone if we pay for every child's education.

(the stage following capitalism in the transition of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles - dictionary.com)'

There's no such thing as society and *if there was* it would only exist as a slave market.

;)I do not say that I exist on my own, or that society is evil, those are your words, nor do I claim that I don't benefit from cooperating with others in society, so all your sarcasm against those positions is misdirected.

Modern collectivism merely replaces a supernatural God as that power with some group called the "proletariat", "society", "the masses", the "master race", etc., to which the individual is subordinate, and which leads logically to totalitarianism.

They cannot be treated the same because society benefits more from the doctor's life than the murderer's.Free market economy is fair and just.

If a person chooses to contribute to society, they receive money in return.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

France is often cited as high tax hell.

So if we added all of that stuff onto what you pay in taxes, you'd find that you actually don't pay as much for what you get as a french person does.Now, you can argue against UHC on two fronts, it seems to me.

Take the sin taxes for example.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance.

Such breaches of the individual liberties of taxpayers are unjust."

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

The right to not be murdered requires policemen, police stations, and taxes to pay for them.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.xd3You pay a tax to support a service.

I don't have to actually read the primary sources myself because the fact is that I don't want to be tax at a higher rate, period.Here's how it should work.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

The middle class will bear more weight (and taxation) upon their shoulders.

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

High taxes create less jobs and innovations.

Canada actually pays 40% more taxes."

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better.

(This is exactly what's happened in education, people are fleeing public schools to private schools and home schools, and teachers unions have opposed those options too).

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

Universal care would protect doctors/hospitals from free-loaders Uncompensated care is a problem for hospitals and doctors.

Universal health care decreases the likelihood of health related problems.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

I go in with any problem, and I can get in to see a doctor within an hour.

I certainly wouldn't say that "more government funding will fix the problem."

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

It's true that some doctors and dentists will choose not to participate in a government-run plan.

Creating a new administrative framework and patient database would be a massive under-taking.'

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines.

Mandates wrongly give insurers millions of new customers Robert Creamer.

I suppose I disagree "with one of the most basic declarations of human rights."

Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

I may not be thrilled with the expense of my current PPO plan, but it's a MILLION times better than what I experienced in the military system. "

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected?

Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?"

Public insurance will be used excessively at greater cost.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."'

The markets are better at providing quality; same with health care.

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

If that argument holds water for you then I'd suggest reading up the utilitarian arguments for capitalism and the free market."

If USA needs change, it is for free market heathcare...eliminate the government interfere we already have and we'll see change for the better.   "

Why should we avoid a system, the free market, when it has worked  in every where else?

Don't confuse a free market system with a charity free system and don't confuse a socialist system with a free charity system.

The more diverse the market, the more competition.

There's no such thing as society and *if there was* it would only exist as a slave market.

Pretty sure the market's success depends upon human interaction anyway.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

They cannot be treated the same because society benefits more from the doctor's life than the murderer's.Free market economy is fair and just.

It maintains the good properties of capitalism as there would still be the exact same incentives to come up with new cures and the free market is still free to compete.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

Unfortunately, all of that great   technology   doesn't do us much good if it can only be used by ten people a year.

http://select.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/opinion/21kristof.html?scp=5&sq=kristof  +infant+mortality+rate&st=nyt18,000 Americans die every year because of a lack of   health   coverage.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

I feel a great amount of sympathy for you that our nation enslaved you for two years.

In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines.

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

This should add another 3-4% onto our economic growth a year.Along with my trade reforms we could have 10% economic growth year over year.

In some parts of Canada, the wait to see a doctor for a routine exam is two years.

The Humana quote was for $196.04 per month, coming out to $2,352.48 per year.

For a typical year, the family of four would probably have six visits to the doctor.

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

They then either spend years struggling trying to pay it off or they just can't pay it and it ruins their credit etc.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance.

And we've made great progress in recent years with reinsurance and risk adjustment mechanisms to handle high-risk people.

And we've made great progress in recent years with reinsurance and risk adjustment mechanisms to handle high-risk people.

The costs of doctor's consultation, medical tests, operations, equipments, hospitals, utilities will be in billions of dollars.

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?'

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Quality of health care is much worse under universal health care.

I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.

Unfortunately, all of that great   technology   doesn't do us much good if it can only be used by ten people a year.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  So what's being talked about right now isn't that as much as it is a heavily regulated new system of private insurance companies.

So if we added all of that stuff onto what you pay in taxes, you'd find that you actually don't pay as much for what you get as a french person does.Now, you can argue against UHC on two fronts, it seems to me.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

224 (p. 118) provides that 18 months after the bill becomes law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what a "qualified plan" covers and how much you'll be legally required to pay for it.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

In some parts of Canada, the wait to see a doctor for a routine exam is two years.

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

They then either spend years struggling trying to pay it off or they just can't pay it and it ruins their credit etc.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

And we've made great progress in recent years with reinsurance and risk adjustment mechanisms to handle high-risk people.

Universal health care is wrongheaded to the extent that it involves protecting individuals from themselves. '

Health care is a basic human right or entitlement Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights.

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

Universal health care holds some individuals accountable for the actions of others.    '

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

Socializing anything involves taking individual decisions and "socializing" any negative effects to the community instead of limiting it to the individual.'

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

For example, governments, such as Canada, have outlawed medical care if the service is paid for by private individual funds.'

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Universal health care risks monopsony: Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.'

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Modern collectivism merely replaces a supernatural God as that power with some group called the "proletariat", "society", "the masses", the "master race", etc., to which the individual is subordinate, and which leads logically to totalitarianism.

Each individual can choose their own path to pursue happiness because nobody's path is the same.

Such breaches of the individual liberties of taxpayers are unjust."

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

Productive individuals are what makes a country great.'

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Universal health care is a social good, not merely an economic good Universal health care generally decreases human misery and increases human welfare.

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

Socialized medicine is a complete disaster all around the world, the more thorough the implementation the more disastarous the results.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world still does things that defy belief.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.

Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided. '

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

The markets are better at providing quality; same with health care.

Public health insurance creates two-tiers of quality.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

Universal health care is a social good, not merely an economic good Universal health care generally decreases human misery and increases human welfare.

Whether universal health care is a social good is inconsequential.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

Perhaps you should attempt to quantify it if you want to argue that this helps to explain some of the difference in life expectancy.

In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines.

So if you take the wrong legal drug you can go to the doctor and get help not thrown in jail to be raped and have you future life destroyed by our greedy out of control so called leader house/senate.

Therefore, since you obviously lean toward socialism in your opinions, the fact that you say you love capitalism is completely hypocritical.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

That means we already spend more per person than France, Canada or the UK does... in fact, only Germany and Iceland spend more per person than the United States when it comes to public funding.

I don't have to actually read the primary sources myself because the fact is that I don't want to be tax at a higher rate, period.Here's how it should work.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Most people believe that the Constitution does in fact give the government the right to impose social programs.

Finally, because the government sets the prices, inventors and manufacturers of medical equipment will just fade away.

Government has a cost incentive to invest in preventive care Paul Krugman, Robin Wells.

Government-funded universal health care would violate patient privacy - Sue Blevins.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

Universal health care will have rules that decrease patient flexibility "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?"

Balanced Politics.org - "Government-controlled health care would lead to a decrease in patient flexibility.

A right to health care is not necessary in taking care of sick patients.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health.

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

Universal health care allows investments in longer-term patient relationships.

Balanced Politics.org - "Government-mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care.

But, what is likely to make the most money is often at odds with public and patient interests. '

Single-payer, universal health care results in long waits for patients Canada is a prime example of this.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Creating a new administrative framework and patient database would be a massive under-taking.'

Balanced Politics.org - "A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation.

Health care databases threaten to violate the privacy of patients.'

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Having patients involved financially in decision making  should help physicians with several discussions.

First, patients often want an expensive diagnostic test.

Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.

Second, this strategy would encourage patients to use appropriate generic drugs.

June 11, 2009: "the public option puts government firmly in the middle of the relationship between patients and their doctors.

- And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims.

Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine.'

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

An average nursing assignment is determined by most facilities to be at 4-5 to ensure safe care for all patients.

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"
