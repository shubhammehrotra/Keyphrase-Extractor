When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

Greater access to health insurance does not improve public health'

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

This affects both private and public healthcare.

[...] The mission of a public health insurance company will be your health, not the financial health of stockholders.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

(hence why i say them) But nice usage of my little ass umption ;) As to your second point.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Maybe I'm wrong but I had a strange idea once.

I don't want to live under your ideal of freedom and liberty to all (if you can afford it).

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

224 (p. 118) provides that 18 months after the bill becomes law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what a "qualified plan" covers and how much you'll be legally required to pay for it.

That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.xd3You pay a tax to support a service.

In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines.

Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

Better technologies and treatments in private health care aids prevention.

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

Universal health care, therefore, could be expected to see fewer innovations and medical advancements.  '

Costs are inconsequential if health care is considered a universal right.

Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.'

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

The flawed premise behind "universal health care" is regarding health care as a "right".

This is why "universal health care" is such a grossly immoral policy, and should be opposed as such.'

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. '

Some would argue that health care is a right.

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.

You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you.

You apparently have no problems unless it involves the words "health care".

Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?

We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well.

We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy. "

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

I don't think military structured health care is an equitable comparison.

Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Don't worry, I'm sure there are many visions for universal   health care   in this country.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses.

And a public insurance plan will invest in health care in our communities."'

if anyone can give all their citizans proper health care its the USA.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

Illegal immigrants wound not get the health care because you have to show proof you are a US citizen.

Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money.

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

So, if the government gives people health care, what does the government have to take?

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

Using the soviet union isn't the best example, especially when you didn't even note anything on health care policy.

What about all the countries that have universal health care now?

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Free health care isn't "free".

He doesn't have a health care plan.

I just don't see free for all health care happening anytime soon.

And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).

It is insane that the US does not have universal health care.

I'm against depending on the government for our health care.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

In the end, therefore, a public plan may leave more people without insurance, employer-provided or otherwise.

If USA needs change, it is for free market heathcare...eliminate the government interfere we already have and we'll see change for the better.   "

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

I agree, but I'm also wondering what people think needs to improve?

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

To believe in my plan you should first watch the documentary SICKO by Roger Moore.

First you start with a dishonest heading: "Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System" Then you admit within the first couple of sentences that the title is nonsense.

Private insurance puts profit first; public insurance puts health first Richard Kirsch, National Campaign Manager for Health Care for America Now!

May 15, 2009: "Putting you first.

Combined, this needless administration consumes one-third (31 percent) of Americansxd5 health dollars.

This is why you always have to fill out a lengthy health history whenever you go to a new physician."'

Balanced Politics.org - "Government-controlled health care would lead to a decrease in patient flexibility.

Universal health care risks monopsony: Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.'

Government-control of databases better protect privacy than companies.

The alternative to a government-controlled health care database is only a privately owned health care databases.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

You see, when you are free, you control your life...which means you are not at anyonexd5s mercy.

Insurers should not be trusted with sole control of health insurance Jacob Hacker.

So if you take the wrong legal drug you can go to the doctor and get help not thrown in jail to be raped and have you future life destroyed by our greedy out of control so called leader house/senate.

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

The denial of these rights by the people who control them have led to revolution after revolution... some violent and some more of an   evolution   than a revolution.

there was never a questino regarding abortion or welfare or 'universal healthcare'i just would remind all Americans that " He who can regulate a thing, controls that thing".

Have you been given control of the lives of your local police officers?Along the same lines, are you "enslaving" the military, who provides your national defense?

So what if she has to take some out due to an uncontrollable circumstance?'

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

Price controls never work.

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."'

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

Insurance companies are already tying the hands of doctors somewhat.

But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans.

Government-control of databases better protect privacy than companies.

With these choices in mind, it is better that health care information be held by the government than by less-regulated companies.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

If you are referring to insurance companies as the sellers than you may not understand the UHC bill.

Increasing competition between insurance companies will force them to reduce spending and maximize customer base.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  So what's being talked about right now isn't that as much as it is a heavily regulated new system of private insurance companies.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

Hospitals that operate for profit doctors the AMA insurance companies they are all getting rich the way it is and we are stuck with this system that we have.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

Private companies reduce their risk by disqualifying people that exhibit risk.

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine.'

Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.

[...] The mission of health insurance companies is a healthy bottom line, not your health.

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

You have pharma companies charging an arm and a leg for products that aren't worth the price.

The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

And insurance companies will continue to profit by discriminating against sick people."'

By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance.

Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices.

Finally, because the government sets the prices, inventors and manufacturers of medical equipment will just fade away.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

You have pharma companies charging an arm and a leg for products that aren't worth the price.

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

Therefore, in countries where the population is aging, it may be important to avoid a universal health care program."

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

Have you been given control of the lives of your local police officers?Along the same lines, are you "enslaving" the military, who provides your national defense?

I feel a great amount of sympathy for you that our nation enslaved you for two years.

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

Every other industrialized nation has it, which puts our business at a disadvantage.4.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."'

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Creating a new administrative framework and patient database would be a massive under-taking.'

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

I have presented evidence that suggests that universal health schemes work out cheaper.

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

Why should we avoid a system, the free market, when it has worked  in every where else?

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected?

You also know I'm correct... but to do so would be to acknowledge to you small mind that perhaps the system we've been operating under doesn't work so hot.

If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.

I also think we should be entitled to the same things as were our founding fathers.This country was founded on the principles that stated "You have the right to work hard, and you are entitled to exactly those things which you earn.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

Of course if my wife gets laid off like a few dozen of her co-workers did last week, then I'm totally screwed.

It is equally absurd to believe that all 50 million of these people living in the United States can be helped by "charity work."

I don't have to actually read the primary sources myself because the fact is that I don't want to be tax at a higher rate, period.Here's how it should work.

And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all.

If you oppose Universal Healthcare, what about the current system do you think works well?

Take Sweden for example, where a person can walk into a hospital at any moment and get treated without the gratuitous amount of paperwork, or questions like, "Who's your insurance carrier?

Price controls never work.

You should have to work for your stuff.'

And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).

The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).

The myth that "bipartisan" legislation works better than partisan legislation is widespread, but virtually no real evidence supports it.

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

Society should strive to defend and care for the needy and vulnerable, instead of subjecting them to a system that punishes them for their disadvantages.'

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

As most people know, most doctor's visits end with "take this and call me if it doesn't get better" which should hardly be seen as "preventative" of anything.'

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness.

For those that will contract illnesses or cancers regardless of any preventative measures they take, such high-end treatment is welcome. "

I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education?

In the end, therefore, a public plan may leave more people without insurance, employer-provided or otherwise.

Unless, they are fat, old, smoke, or are part of some other segment that is considered expendable to the government's balance sheets.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

That means we already spend more per person than France, Canada or the UK does... in fact, only Germany and Iceland spend more per person than the United States when it comes to public funding.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

Their governments have simply made an arbitrary decision to spend less, but they will also get less."

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.
