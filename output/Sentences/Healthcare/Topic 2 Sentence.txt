We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy. "

But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans.

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."'

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

If you are referring to insurance companies as the sellers than you may not understand the UHC bill.

Increasing competition between insurance companies will force them to reduce spending and maximize customer base.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  So what's being talked about right now isn't that as much as it is a heavily regulated new system of private insurance companies.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

Hospitals that operate for profit doctors the AMA insurance companies they are all getting rich the way it is and we are stuck with this system that we have.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine.'

[...] The mission of health insurance companies is a healthy bottom line, not your health.

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).

And insurance companies will continue to profit by discriminating against sick people."'

But the millions of Americans who are tired of increasing costs and decreasing benefits should have the chance to opt into a program that will offer affordable, quality care, says Health Care for America Now's Richard Kirsch."'

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Government has a cost incentive to invest in preventive care Paul Krugman, Robin Wells.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.'

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

Universal health care reduces administrative costs (i.e.

Universal health care risks monopsony: Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.'

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

However, any costs not covered by insurance must be absorbed by all the rest of us, which means even higher premiums."'

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. '

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.

Health coverage would cost more for unhealthier people.

Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

The cost of   health care  .

The cost of university--whatever one you can get into, even Yale or Princeton.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Since I have 4 wisdom teeth, it will cost me about 1500 bucks in total.

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

Public insurance option is less costly than private insurance "Why The Public Health Insurance Option Is Worth Fighting For".

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

Yet a range of studies demonstrate that public insurance is able to provide a given level of benefits for less than they would cost through private insurance.

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

June 24, 2009: "[the critics say] the public plan starts off with an unfair advantage because it's likely to have lower administrative costs.

I mean when you don't have insurance and you have to go to the hospital for any type of surgery or more than a "doctor visitation" the cost really hurts those who do not have a lot of money.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"

The costs of doctor's consultation, medical tests, operations, equipments, hospitals, utilities will be in billions of dollars.

Public insurance will be used excessively at greater cost.

Again, the worse the actual performance, the better Medicare's administrative costs appear as a percentage of total spending."'

This cost-shifting amounts to a forced subsidy.

April 13, 2009: "As people gravitate to 'free' or heavily subsidized care, the inevitably explosive costs will be covered in part with increased outlays to keep premiums artificially low or even offer extra benefits.

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

For example, would "elective" surgeries such as breast implants, wart removal, hair restoration, and lasik eye surgery be covered?

For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009)."'

Single-payer, universal health care results in long waits for patients Canada is a prime example of this.

For example, governments, such as Canada, have outlawed medical care if the service is paid for by private individual funds.'

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

For example, Dr. Linda Halderman shed some important light on this.

Whatxd5s interesting here is that you would actually use the example of public education to justify socialized medicine.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Therefore, in countries where the population is aging, it may be important to avoid a universal health care program."

Any proposal to shift to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry.
