Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness.

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

Universal health care risks monopsony: Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.'

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

American Medical Student Association (AMSA) - Statement supporting universal health care'

The flawed premise behind "universal health care" is regarding health care as a "right".

This is why "universal health care" is such a grossly immoral policy, and should be opposed as such.'

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?

We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well.

We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy. "

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

What about all the countries that have universal health care now?

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).

It is insane that the US does not have universal health care.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

Put some facts before us, please.'

There are some facts about those infant mortality statistics that perhaps you should consider...namely, the criteria used to compile them.

If you don't like the fact that a particular company hires people you donxd5t approve of (moving jobs across seas), you are free to protest by refusing to buy their products.

De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

Therefore, since you obviously lean toward socialism in your opinions, the fact that you say you love capitalism is completely hypocritical.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

That means we already spend more per person than France, Canada or the UK does... in fact, only Germany and Iceland spend more per person than the United States when it comes to public funding.

I don't have to actually read the primary sources myself because the fact is that I don't want to be tax at a higher rate, period.Here's how it should work.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims.

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

Public health insurance offers citizens more choices Jacob Hacker.

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

What we need is to get government out of our wallets so people can have their own money needed to purchase and own their own health insurance."'

These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.'

June 11, 2009: "Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance.

But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans.

This also explains the drug industryxd5s staunch opposition to single-payer national health insurance."'

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Insurers should not be trusted with sole control of health insurance Jacob Hacker.

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

I don't have a link for this, but if you doubt me please go to an ER and ask for a colonoscopy or a mammogram.The American Cancer Society found that (and this is sort of a duh thing)   cancer   kills more often if you don't have adequate health insurance.

I'd like to have   health insurance   that I didn't have to ask each time to make sure what part they were going to pay."

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

Why can't we buy health insurance from another state if it is cheaper?Here is a great article that I suggest should everyone read.

I wouldn't want anyone to feel they were "drafted" into a health insurance system that they didn't want.

June 11, 2009: "Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance.

Public health insurance creates two-tiers of quality.

Finally, UHC would end health insurance.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance.

Universal care would protect doctors/hospitals from free-loaders Uncompensated care is a problem for hospitals and doctors.

Universal health care decreases the likelihood of health related problems.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

I go in with any problem, and I can get in to see a doctor within an hour.

I certainly wouldn't say that "more government funding will fix the problem."

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"

Many of the problems are the result of government intrusion into healthcare.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

As for a moral obligation - we have already, as a society, decided it is best for eeryone if we pay for every child's education.

(the stage following capitalism in the transition of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles - dictionary.com)'

There's no such thing as society and *if there was* it would only exist as a slave market.

;)I do not say that I exist on my own, or that society is evil, those are your words, nor do I claim that I don't benefit from cooperating with others in society, so all your sarcasm against those positions is misdirected.

Modern collectivism merely replaces a supernatural God as that power with some group called the "proletariat", "society", "the masses", the "master race", etc., to which the individual is subordinate, and which leads logically to totalitarianism.

They cannot be treated the same because society benefits more from the doctor's life than the murderer's.Free market economy is fair and just.

If a person chooses to contribute to society, they receive money in return.

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

I also think we should be entitled to the same things as were our founding fathers.This country was founded on the principles that stated "You have the right to work hard, and you are entitled to exactly those things which you earn.

One of the interesting things that popped out to me was the projected deficit increase in billions.

The things you propose are not fail safe.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world still does things that defy belief.

--Milton.Dictionary.com defines the term general:1. of or pertaining to all persons or things belonging to a group or category: a general meeting of the employees.

June 6, 2009: "The ONLY reason there is consideration of continuing the failed, greedy, destructive corporate insurance system is because the few who get rich off of it are paying off politicians to keep things they way they are.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?"

Using it as an argument fails as it's only an appeal to authority."

Most uninsured simply can't afford it; it's not a choice Kao-Ping Chua, "Arguments and counterarguments about universal health care".

If that argument holds water for you then I'd suggest reading up the utilitarian arguments for capitalism and the free market."

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a "right.

However, the rest of your argument I believe is false.UHC would not benefit the majority of people.

That's all..... and it's a very easy argument to make and a hard one to argue against.

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

And your argument about the working class makes no sense at all.

The arguments for a public option as the only way to achieve certain objectives just don't stack up."'

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

Socialized medicine is a complete disaster all around the world, the more thorough the implementation the more disastarous the results.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world still does things that defy belief.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

If there is a conflict between life and money life should prevail because it is a right while money is a want not a need. '

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Perhaps you should attempt to quantify it if you want to argue that this helps to explain some of the difference in life expectancy.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

I suggest you review the fundamental right to life, and the derivative rights liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?'

In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines.
