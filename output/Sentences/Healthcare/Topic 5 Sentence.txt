Single-payer health care allows bargaining for lower drug prices "Single-Payer FAQ".

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices.

Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.

Our post offices used to be part of a great bureaucracy; now the local post office appears to be run as franchised businesses.

Unfortunately, all of that great   technology   doesn't do us much good if it can only be used by ten people a year.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

Whatxd5s interesting here is that you would actually use the example of public education to justify socialized medicine.

Don't confuse a free market system with a charity free system and don't confuse a socialist system with a free charity system.

Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. "The case for public plan choice in national health reform".

And because its immoral it is impractical, as any attempt at socialized medicine around the globe has shown.

Society is evil, as is socialism, as is anything that forces any one man to have to interact with others.

Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

Tyrants, "social justice" totalitarians, humanitarians with a "good cause" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough.

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

Public insurance bureaucracies are better than private ones Paul Waldman.

For example, Dr. Linda Halderman shed some important light on this.

Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

I suppose I disagree "with one of the most basic declarations of human rights."

But in our judgment, if that many Americans were to decide that such a plan is a better deal for them and their families, that would be a good thing.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

Tyrants, "social justice" totalitarians, humanitarians with a "good cause" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough.

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

That means we already spend more per person than France, Canada or the UK does... in fact, only Germany and Iceland spend more per person than the United States when it comes to public funding.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

Don't worry, I'm sure there are many visions for universal   health care   in this country.

Members of a civilized   society   recognize that all humans are vulnerable to diseasexd1this is something we have in commonxd1and so we willingly pooling our resources to protect each of us against the hazards of fate.'

If you disagree with that you disagree with the United Nations' and the United States' definition of Universal Human Rights.'

It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

The number of uninsured citizens has grown to over 40 million.

The myth that "bipartisan" legislation works better than partisan legislation is widespread, but virtually no real evidence supports it.

Do you want to be FORCED to get something done just cause the government papers says you should.

Single-payer health care allows bargaining for lower drug prices "Single-Payer FAQ".

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

If private insurers believe their product is superior, they should not be worried about a public option."

Public option weakens private insurers, forcing many out of their plans "The End of Private Health Insurance".

The question is: 'Why should policymakers give private insurers the exclusive right to cover Americans?

If private insurers can better meet our goals for the health system, why object to a level competition with public plans?'"'

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

Hundreds of private insurers offer sufficient choices.

Public insurance option may force private insurers to increase rates.

Mandates wrongly give insurers millions of new customers Robert Creamer.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

But, this is unfair and contrary to the higher moral principles upon which societies should be founded.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

For those that will contract illnesses or cancers regardless of any preventative measures they take, such high-end treatment is welcome. "

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

However, any costs not covered by insurance must be absorbed by all the rest of us, which means even higher premiums."'

This is a highly disruptive act that would involve massive job loss.

But even if a public option available to all takes the highly improbable step of paying at some midpoint between private and Medicare rates, nearly 68 million people will still be crowded out of private insurance."'

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. "The case for public plan choice in national health reform".

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

Have you been given control of the lives of your local police officers?Along the same lines, are you "enslaving" the military, who provides your national defense?

I feel a great amount of sympathy for you that our nation enslaved you for two years.

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

Every other industrialized nation has it, which puts our business at a disadvantage.4.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.

look at it this way, alot of people are dying because they cant afford medical insurance or that they have another helth issue going on.

First you start with a dishonest heading: "Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System" Then you admit within the first couple of sentences that the title is nonsense.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

High taxes create less jobs and innovations.

I think there are some small ways to fix all of these problems without going to UHC.

You also know I'm correct... but to do so would be to acknowledge to you small mind that perhaps the system we've been operating under doesn't work so hot.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

In addition, Ixd5d allow them to put their excess HSA savings in bonds and cds so that they earn a small amount of interest with virtually no chance of loss.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

That you work harder to buy more stuff?

not really, because all those people are under the thumb of those who make OTHERS work harder while they receive more compensation.

I also think we should be entitled to the same things as were our founding fathers.This country was founded on the principles that stated "You have the right to work hard, and you are entitled to exactly those things which you earn.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

But, this is unfair and contrary to the higher moral principles upon which societies should be founded.

I am a little confused with your point on the single buyer and competition.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

(hence why i say them) But nice usage of my little ass umption ;) As to your second point.

People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better.

For example, would "elective" surgeries such as breast implants, wart removal, hair restoration, and lasik eye surgery be covered?

They can't pay for the surgery, so they're screwed.

I mean when you don't have insurance and you have to go to the hospital for any type of surgery or more than a "doctor visitation" the cost really hurts those who do not have a lot of money.

/>   /> He said, "You don't get it...it was EMERGENCY surgery..."  />   /> "No sh!t, " I replied.

The only aspects of anything medical that would make them consumers is BOTOX, cosmetic surgery, and the like.

They will end up paying less percentage wise than their secretaries...   and they'll even admit it.

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

Just as Americans donxd5t turn people away from hospital emergency rooms, Americans donxd5t leave people behind when it comes to health care insurance."'

I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education?

Anyone who's sick can go to the emergency room and the hospital has to treat them whether they can pay or not.

De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/us/04pharmacy.html?ref=todayspaper  Yes, you can go to an emergency room no matter what.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

;)I do not say that I exist on my own, or that society is evil, those are your words, nor do I claim that I don't benefit from cooperating with others in society, so all your sarcasm against those positions is misdirected.

You apparently have no problems unless it involves the words "health care".

In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines.

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.

This is, unfortunately, one of the downfalls of trying to debate US politics when not actually American.

Ergo, that is why the proposed legislation of Healthcare reform is so hotly debated in the US.

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

Universal health care makes a centralized national database possible "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?".

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

(Since it's impossible to know what article you're referring to, there is no way to check the data the reporters used to make sure they're making the right comparisons and drawing the correct inferences; it's not even possible to verify that the WSJ article actually backs your position.

They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible.

Do large numbers of uninsured give cause to universal health care?

Could you provide a link to the correct bill for me please?'

'It would be a huge mistake for the left to torpedo reform over this question.'

I feel a great amount of sympathy for you that our nation enslaved you for two years.

Our post offices used to be part of a great bureaucracy; now the local post office appears to be run as franchised businesses.

You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. '

There will be waiting lines, there will be rationing, there will be monumental incompetence and arrogant bureaucracy.

Do you really want tomorrow's limitation...bureaucracy?

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Hospitals that operate for profit doctors the AMA insurance companies they are all getting rich the way it is and we are stuck with this system that we have.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

June 6, 2009: "The ONLY reason there is consideration of continuing the failed, greedy, destructive corporate insurance system is because the few who get rich off of it are paying off politicians to keep things they way they are.

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Having patients involved financially in decision making  should help physicians with several discussions.

Their governments have simply made an arbitrary decision to spend less, but they will also get less."

Universal health care holds some individuals accountable for the actions of others.    '

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

June 27, 2009: "The largest existing public health programs xd1 Medicare and Medicaid xd1 are the main reason that the governmentxd5s long-term finances are in shambles.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

Whatxd5s interesting here is that you would actually use the example of public education to justify socialized medicine.

Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. "The case for public plan choice in national health reform".

And because its immoral it is impractical, as any attempt at socialized medicine around the globe has shown.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

Modern collectivism merely replaces a supernatural God as that power with some group called the "proletariat", "society", "the masses", the "master race", etc., to which the individual is subordinate, and which leads logically to totalitarianism.

It's a lie aimed at a specific group of people to get them riled against the bill.3.

Most uninsured simply can't afford it; it's not a choice Kao-Ping Chua, "Arguments and counterarguments about universal health care".

If that argument holds water for you then I'd suggest reading up the utilitarian arguments for capitalism and the free market."

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

Promoting general welfare would involve more than simply making sure the law/regulations we put in place do "not harm the country.

Promoting general welfare would involve more than simply making sure the law/regulations we put in place do 'not harm the country.'"Seriously?

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

April 13, 2009: "As people gravitate to 'free' or heavily subsidized care, the inevitably explosive costs will be covered in part with increased outlays to keep premiums artificially low or even offer extra benefits.

Health care is a need, but not a "right", and that's a critical difference.

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

Perhaps you should attempt to quantify it if you want to argue that this helps to explain some of the difference in life expectancy.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

Similarly, innovations in coordinating care for elders with chronic illness in private plans have provided a useful foundation for care-coordination demonstrations in the public Medicare plan."'

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

Universal health care, therefore, could be expected to see fewer innovations and medical advancements.  '

Public health insurance offers citizens more choices Jacob Hacker.

With these choices in mind, it is better that health care information be held by the government than by less-regulated companies.

which include dietary choices,Where is your evidence that Americans make different dietary choices to Canadians, Australians and the British?

Hundreds of private insurers offer sufficient choices.

Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices.

It is equally absurd to believe that all 50 million of these people living in the United States can be helped by "charity work."

The results of robust private competition to provide the Medicare drug benefit underscore this.

Single-payer health care allows bargaining for lower drug prices "Single-Payer FAQ".

This also explains the drug industryxd5s staunch opposition to single-payer national health insurance."'

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Do large numbers of uninsured give cause to universal health care?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

As most people know, most doctor's visits end with "take this and call me if it doesn't get better" which should hardly be seen as "preventative" of anything.'

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness.

For those that will contract illnesses or cancers regardless of any preventative measures they take, such high-end treatment is welcome. "

I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education?

In the end, therefore, a public plan may leave more people without insurance, employer-provided or otherwise.

Unless, they are fat, old, smoke, or are part of some other segment that is considered expendable to the government's balance sheets.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a "right.

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

That means we already spend more per person than France, Canada or the UK does... in fact, only Germany and Iceland spend more per person than the United States when it comes to public funding.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

Their governments have simply made an arbitrary decision to spend less, but they will also get less."

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

Well I'm glad you have done so, what you get from unemployment is less that 50% of your total monthly income when you were employed and this is on top of not receiving insurance.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

This is why health must be considered a basic human right.'

Health care is considered a right in international law.

Whether universal health care is a legitimate "burden" on the tax payer should be considered inconsequential.

Canada residents will often go to the U.S. or offer additional money to get their health care needs taken care of."'

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

Costs are inconsequential if health care is considered a universal right.

Unless, they are fat, old, smoke, or are part of some other segment that is considered expendable to the government's balance sheets.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.

Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.

If you have never dealt with these issues, you simply can't imagine how bad it is, I'm not exagerating, ask around.

Major Medical covers some very basic health issues.

Most people believe that the Constitution does in fact give the government the right to impose social programs.

224 (p. 118) provides that 18 months after the bill becomes law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what a "qualified plan" covers and how much you'll be legally required to pay for it.

That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.xd3You pay a tax to support a service.

In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines.

Universal health care makes a centralized national database possible "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?".

Balanced Politics.org - "We can develop a centralized national database which makes diagnosis and treatment easier for doctors.

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.

Under the QAPI program, the Secretary shall establish standards relating to such facilities and provide technical assistance to such facilities on the development of best practices in order to meet such standards with quality assessment and assurance activities conducted under clause RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT MONITORAn independent monitor (1) conduct periodic reviews and prepare root- cause quality and deficiency analyses if facilities are in compliance with State and Federal laws and regulations applicable to the facilities; (2) undertake sustained oversight of the facilities to involve the owners of the chain and the principal business owners in facilitating compliance with State and Federal laws and regulations applicable to the facilities; (3) analyze the management structure, distribution of expenditures, and nurse staffing levels of facilities in relation to resident census, staff turnover rates, and tenure.

So you also hold the view that the most powerful weapon corrupt corporations have is government regulation, bailouts, etc.	0	0.0017723797354847193

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

I suggest you review the fundamental right to life, and the derivative rights liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness.

This, in my personal view is what a good government should really aim to do."

--Milton.Dictionary.com defines the term general:1. of or pertaining to all persons or things belonging to a group or category: a general meeting of the employees.

Let Darwin be Darwin and soon we'll only have the lower middle class to worry about.

And, of course, one cannot pursue happiness if they are in a hospital bed.

And, of course, this model can be expanded out further, if need be, to aid the needy.'

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Of course if my wife gets laid off like a few dozen of her co-workers did last week, then I'm totally screwed.

Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?'
