Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

A universal health plan means the entire health insurance industry would be unnecessary.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

June 27, 2009: "Which raises the question: Would the existence of a dominant government provider of health insurance be good or bad?

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

The question is: 'Why should policymakers give private insurers the exclusive right to cover Americans?

Should we adopt a version of the Massachusetts plan?We could argue this question as a moral issue.

I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.

Take Sweden for example, where a person can walk into a hospital at any moment and get treated without the gratuitous amount of paperwork, or questions like, "Who's your insurance carrier?

'It would be a huge mistake for the left to torpedo reform over this question.'

The case for public plan.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

The case for public plan.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor.

For example, would "elective" surgeries such as breast implants, wart removal, hair restoration, and lasik eye surgery be covered?

Indications from the Medicare Advantage experience suggest that, if anything, private plans would most likely be favored over a public plan.

For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009)."'

The case for public plan.

Similarly, innovations in coordinating care for elders with chronic illness in private plans have provided a useful foundation for care-coordination demonstrations in the public Medicare plan."'

But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans.

Competition in private insurance can be improved without public plan.

The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage.

A universal health plan means the entire health insurance industry would be unnecessary.

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

Public option weakens private insurers, forcing many out of their plans "The End of Private Health Insurance".

The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage.

In the end, therefore, a public plan may leave more people without insurance, employer-provided or otherwise.

You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. '

The case for public plan.

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

If private insurers can better meet our goals for the health system, why object to a level competition with public plans?'"'

If you are aware and read you know our so-called leaders senate/house lie to us and waste our money and vote with the corporations that pay them through PACs (political action committees) having said that here is my plan.

To believe in my plan you should first watch the documentary SICKO by Roger Moore.

Should we adopt a version of the Massachusetts plan?We could argue this question as a moral issue.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. "The case for public plan choice in national health reform".

Below are some of the highlights of the BILL xd4xd4Americaxd5s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009xd5xd5 which is self explanatory.

But in our judgment, if that many Americans were to decide that such a plan is a better deal for them and their families, that would be a good thing.

Inefficient private plans would wither.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

The case for public plan.

The Institute for America's Future: "over the last generation, public insurance has pioneered new payment and quality-improvement methods that have frequently set the standard for private plans.

The public plan would be subject to all sorts of political interventions and would be required to delay making changes in health plans until it had solicited extensive public comments.

In this country, if you have no money, you don't get a good insurance plan which is not fair.

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

The case for public plan.

I also advocate for plans like MassHealth.

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

What about all the countries that have universal health care now?

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).

It is insane that the US does not have universal health care.

Health care is a basic human right or entitlement Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine.'

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

Whether universal health care is a legitimate "burden" on the tax payer should be considered inconsequential.

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

People have a right to pay more for better health care Froma Harrop.

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

As for a moral obligation - we have already, as a society, decided it is best for eeryone if we pay for every child's education.

Anyone who's sick can go to the emergency room and the hospital has to treat them whether they can pay or not.

If you are aware and read you know our so-called leaders senate/house lie to us and waste our money and vote with the corporations that pay them through PACs (political action committees) having said that here is my plan.

Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.

If you have more money you can get better insurance so someone that earns alot of money should be able to pay for better heatlh care then some bum off the streets.'

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

Small businesses can survive for they do not need to pay expensive medical insurance, & can hire more people, more income   taxes  , more buyer of goods, thus, envigorating the economy'

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

I'll explain this concept below, because I think there might be confusion about it.What single payer means is, you pick your doctor.

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

So if we added all of that stuff onto what you pay in taxes, you'd find that you actually don't pay as much for what you get as a french person does.Now, you can argue against UHC on two fronts, it seems to me.

I'd like to have   health insurance   that I didn't have to ask each time to make sure what part they were going to pay."

It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system.

Yes, this is because they have more money, but don't you want your employer to have more money than you so they can afford to pay you?

They will end up paying less percentage wise than their secretaries...   and they'll even admit it.

You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you.

If that doesn't pay enough, I will strive to be a research director for a biomedical   technology   company to design and test biomedical devices to increase the quality of life for many people.

Public option is really about making way for a single-payer system Gregory Mankiw.

During the presidential campaign, he said, 'If I were designing a system from scratch, I would probably go ahead with a single-payer system.'"'

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims.

When a hospital writes off a bill who pays?

Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance.

Such breaches of the individual liberties of taxpayers are unjust."

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

The right to not be murdered requires policemen, police stations, and taxes to pay for them.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

224 (p. 118) provides that 18 months after the bill becomes law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what a "qualified plan" covers and how much you'll be legally required to pay for it.

That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.xd3You pay a tax to support a service.

The Institute for America's Future: "over the last generation, public insurance has pioneered new payment and quality-improvement methods that have frequently set the standard for private plans.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Every European I have met scoffs and is incredulous that we have no universal healthcare and that we pay for university.

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

They can't pay for the surgery, so they're screwed.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4.

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

They prioritize profits, denying payment for care whenever possible.

The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

If they are on the Cigna plan, they will pay a $30 deductible per visit plus 20% which comes to $324.

June 6, 2009: "The ONLY reason there is consideration of continuing the failed, greedy, destructive corporate insurance system is because the few who get rich off of it are paying off politicians to keep things they way they are.

They then either spend years struggling trying to pay it off or they just can't pay it and it ruins their credit etc.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

Canada actually pays 40% more taxes."

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Yes after an initial payment of lets say a pound or two per visit.'

Doctors and nurses shouldn't work for free, the government should pay them, we should not have to.

It is not my obligation to pay for the healthcare of others.

As a Christian, I am all for charity and think the church needs to step up to that far better than it has done so, but forced payment on my part removes that possibility.

Certainly, healthcare isn't an equal right if some are paying for themselves and others, and others are contributing nothing.'

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

Therefore, in countries where the population is aging, it may be important to avoid a universal health care program."

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

Do you really doubt that medical care is NOT superior in the US than in other countries?

Look to examples in other countries, read your history books.

Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.

Some countries already have this and they dont know why we are stuck in the stone age.

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

There are 30 million people in Canada and this is the reason why Canada is not as prosperous as other capitalist countries.

What about all the countries that have universal health care now?

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

I want to earn enough to take time off work to teach them morals and educate them on how to be a better person to themselves and to others.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

A universal health plan means the entire health insurance industry would be unnecessary.

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

The public plan would be subject to all sorts of political interventions and would be required to delay making changes in health plans until it had solicited extensive public comments.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

You see, when you are free, you control your life...which means you are not at anyonexd5s mercy.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing "imposed" on them is that they not violate my rights.

I wouldn't want anyone to feel they were "drafted" into a health insurance system that they didn't want.

if anyone can give all their citizans proper health care its the USA.

But, altogether, it is not my responsibility to "make up" for anyone elses well being.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

And, by ensuring that individuals do not fall ill or victim to being uninsured, a public insurance option will ensure that individuals stay economically productive. '

will u tell me the difference between socialism and capitalism?'

It maintains the good properties of capitalism as there would still be the exact same incentives to come up with new cures and the free market is still free to compete.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

No universal health care causes "job lock" "The Case for Universal Health Care".

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

I have 2 jobs, but I don't even get more than $1000 every month.

Man, it's the government's job to protect the people.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.

Universal health care is wrongheaded to the extent that it involves protecting individuals from themselves. '

Whether universal health care is analogous to other services is inconsequential.

This is why health must be considered a basic human right.'

Universal health care protects healthy citizens from many health risks.

If citizens have a right to be healthy, they are due some protections from the sickly.

Universal health care is a social good, not merely an economic good Universal health care generally decreases human misery and increases human welfare.

Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.

Universal health care helps them get the care that they need.

Without health care, the poor are more vulnerable and have a harder time achieving their goals.

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

Universal health care holds some individuals accountable for the actions of others.    '

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided. '

Government-funded universal health care would violate patient privacy - Sue Blevins.

Whether universal health care is a social good is inconsequential.

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

Free, universal health care helps the unhealthy in times of need.

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

A right to health care is not necessary in taking care of sick patients.

Most uninsured simply can't afford it; it's not a choice Kao-Ping Chua, "Arguments and counterarguments about universal health care".

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

The benefits are far to diverse to pigeon-hole universal health care as just "welfare".'

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

Universal health care would amount to welfare for the uninsured.

The government should not create a health care system that is aimed primarily at helping the poor and uninsured.

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

Universal health care leads to rationing.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

Universal health care will cut physician cash-flow and disrupt living-standards.

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.'

Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health.

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

Universal health care allows investments in longer-term patient relationships.

Universal health care decreases the likelihood of health related problems.

The single most destructive issue regarding health care in America is the lack of preventative care.

The markets are better at providing quality; same with health care.

The same applies to health care. '

Quality of health care is much worse under universal health care.

June 11, 2009: "Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance.

But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans.

Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

Better technologies and treatments in private health care aids prevention.

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

Universal health care, therefore, could be expected to see fewer innovations and medical advancements.  '

Universal health care creates a universal standard of care Nathan Newman.

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

Government may set one standard of health care, but it may be inferior.

Canada's the wrong model for universal health care.

Public health care is good; it just receives more scrutiny/criticism Public health care systems receive more scrutiny by the public because they are publicly accountable.

Single-payer, universal health care results in long waits for patients Canada is a prime example of this.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

Costs are inconsequential if health care is considered a universal right.

Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.'

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

Therefore, in countries where the population is aging, it may be important to avoid a universal health care program."

Universal health care reduces administrative costs (i.e.

paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Universal health care internationally is better than US system Paul Krugman, Robin Wells.

Millions don't have health insurance in US; universal health care would address this "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?".

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

It must simply read: 'Provide voluntary health insurance for the uninsured.

Just as Americans donxd5t turn people away from hospital emergency rooms, Americans donxd5t leave people behind when it comes to health care insurance."'

It's definitely true that no one has a right to healthcare since this would require enslaving someone else to give it to them.

I think healthcare for all is a worthwhile goal.

I want Universal healthcare, but I think it needs to be private.'

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

I have presented evidence that suggests that universal health schemes work out cheaper.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. '

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

Insurers should not be trusted with sole control of health insurance Jacob Hacker.

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

If private insurers can better meet our goals for the health system, why object to a level competition with public plans?'"'

So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. '

Rather should we develop a minimal health coverage that all should have.

Some would argue that health care is a right.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare.

Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

Health coverage would cost more for unhealthier people.

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?"

Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.

Will limit innovation in   health   information   technology  ?

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

If our primary business competitors (excepting China) have   health   coverage for all, why don't we?

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected?

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. "The case for public plan choice in national health reform".

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

I don't have a link for this, but if you doubt me please go to an ER and ask for a colonoscopy or a mammogram.The American Cancer Society found that (and this is sort of a duh thing)   cancer   kills more often if you don't have adequate health insurance.

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

Morris:xca And what's going to happen is the same thing that goes on in Canada.xca Because of the long wait for colonoscopies, the incidence of colon   cancer   in Canada is 25 percent higher than in the US.And because the two top drugs we use for chemotherapy for advanced stage colon cancer are not available in Canada because of costs, the death rate is 2 % higher.xca 41 percent of Canadians die of colon cancer compared to 32 in the US.O'Reilly:xca That is one of the most compelling things about your book, is that you deliver statistics that say Americans are a lot healthier than Canadians are in the vital disease categoryxd1heart disease, cancer, things like that.xcaMorris:xca Let's quantify it.xca 6 percent lower death rate from heart disease and a 16 percent lower death rate from cancer in the US.xca And Canada has more poor people.	0	9.736777865327895E-4

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

This affects both private and public healthcare.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

I don't think military structured health care is an equitable comparison.

Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Don't worry, I'm sure there are many visions for universal   health care   in this country.

I wouldn't want anyone to feel they were "drafted" into a health insurance system that they didn't want.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

Private insurance puts profit first; public insurance puts health first Richard Kirsch, National Campaign Manager for Health Care for America Now!

[...] The mission of health insurance companies is a healthy bottom line, not your health.

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

[...] The mission of a public health insurance company will be your health, not the financial health of stockholders.

It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses.

And a public insurance plan will invest in health care in our communities."'

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?'

I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff.

The public plan would be subject to all sorts of political interventions and would be required to delay making changes in health plans until it had solicited extensive public comments.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

(She's still in great health, by the way.)

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Finally, UHC would end health insurance.

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

It is insane that the US does not have universal health care.

I'm against depending on the government for our health care.

Small businesses can survive for they do not need to pay expensive medical insurance, & can hire more people, more income   taxes  , more buyer of goods, thus, envigorating the economy'

They cannot be treated the same because society benefits more from the doctor's life than the murderer's.Free market economy is fair and just.

To try to fix the economy?

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

Society is evil, as is socialism, as is anything that forces any one man to have to interact with others.

Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

Therefore, since you obviously lean toward socialism in your opinions, the fact that you say you love capitalism is completely hypocritical.

Here, let me provide you with this handy visual aide:[socialism]----------------------------2--1----------[capitalism] 1 = Where we are now2 = What Democrats want'

will u tell me the difference between socialism and capitalism?'

If you think that is socialism, than you are either being very disingenuous or you are incredibly ignorant.
