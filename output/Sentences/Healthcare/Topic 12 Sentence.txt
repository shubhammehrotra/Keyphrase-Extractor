Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.'

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a "right" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly. '

Universal health care reduces administrative costs (i.e.

Universal health care risks monopsony: Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.'

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

Again, the worse the actual performance, the better Medicare's administrative costs appear as a percentage of total spending."'

April 13, 2009: "As people gravitate to 'free' or heavily subsidized care, the inevitably explosive costs will be covered in part with increased outlays to keep premiums artificially low or even offer extra benefits.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

Taxing everyone more is not going to help.

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Why can't we buy health insurance from another state if it is cheaper?Here is a great article that I suggest should everyone read.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided. '

The government should not create a health care system that is aimed primarily at helping the poor and uninsured.

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

Public health care is good; it just receives more scrutiny/criticism Public health care systems receive more scrutiny by the public because they are publicly accountable.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

paper work) Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Universal health care risks monopsony: Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.'

Any proposal to shift to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry.

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

Public health insurance offers citizens more choices Jacob Hacker.

Public insurance offers an option to uninsured and struggling Richard Kirsch, National Campaign Manager for Health Care for America Now!

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

Many uninsured can easily afford it so should not receive sympathy A significant proportion of the uninsured can easily afford insurance.

What we need is to get government out of our wallets so people can have their own money needed to purchase and own their own health insurance."'

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Insurers/conservatives oppose public insurance because it works Robert Reich.

If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."'

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.'

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

June 11, 2009: "Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance.

But 1,300 companies sell health insurance plans.

Competition in private insurance can be improved without public plan.

Public insurance would destroy private insurance industry Karl Rove.

June 27, 2009: "Which raises the question: Would the existence of a dominant government provider of health insurance be good or bad?

This also explains the drug industryxd5s staunch opposition to single-payer national health insurance."'

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

Health insurance strains on businesses damage global competitiveness '

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Free, universal health care would devastate the insurance industry "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?"

Balanced Politics.org - "A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation.

However, any costs not covered by insurance must be absorbed by all the rest of us, which means even higher premiums."'

Public insurance meets moral obligation to insure the uninsured Ronald R. Mercer, Bullhead City, Ariz. "America, its uninsured need public option".

Public insurance bureaucracies are better than private ones Paul Waldman.

Insurers should not be trusted with sole control of health insurance Jacob Hacker.

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

If you have more money you can get better insurance so someone that earns alot of money should be able to pay for better heatlh care then some bum off the streets.'

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

Public insurance offers a valuable check on private insurance Jacob Hacker.

Will increase supplemental insurance premiums for privatized care?

And for those who have a hard time getting insurance into taking better care of themselves with regular checkups.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

Small businesses can survive for they do not need to pay expensive medical insurance, & can hire more people, more income   taxes  , more buyer of goods, thus, envigorating the economy'

If you are referring to insurance companies as the sellers than you may not understand the UHC bill.

Increasing competition between insurance companies will force them to reduce spending and maximize customer base.

Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. "The case for public plan choice in national health reform".

Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans.

I don't have a link for this, but if you doubt me please go to an ER and ask for a colonoscopy or a mammogram.The American Cancer Society found that (and this is sort of a duh thing)   cancer   kills more often if you don't have adequate health insurance.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21sun1.html?ref=todayspaper  So what's being talked about right now isn't that as much as it is a heavily regulated new system of private insurance companies.

US has existing examples of public insurance, public-private hybrids.Tom Daschle.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

look at it this way, alot of people are dying because they cant afford medical insurance or that they have another helth issue going on.

I'd like to have   health insurance   that I didn't have to ask each time to make sure what part they were going to pay."

Efforts to create a public-private insurance hybrid are in good faith.

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance.

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine.'

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

In this country, if you have no money, you don't get a good insurance plan which is not fair.

Finally, UHC would end health insurance.

Public insurance option is less costly than private insurance "Why The Public Health Insurance Option Is Worth Fighting For".

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Yet a range of studies demonstrate that public insurance is able to provide a given level of benefits for less than they would cost through private insurance.

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

I mean when you don't have insurance and you have to go to the hospital for any type of surgery or more than a "doctor visitation" the cost really hurts those who do not have a lot of money.

Well I'm glad you have done so, what you get from unemployment is less that 50% of your total monthly income when you were employed and this is on top of not receiving insurance.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

So if we added all of that stuff onto what you pay in taxes, you'd find that you actually don't pay as much for what you get as a french person does.Now, you can argue against UHC on two fronts, it seems to me.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

Under this reasoning, a person who comes into the ER is violating a Dr's rights because they owe them a care of duty at this point.

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

50 Gs is enough to put middle or lower class person into debt with ease.

I personally think that it should be cheap rather than freely available.

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided. '

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?"

Health care is a basic human right or entitlement Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

Securing a "right" to universal health means impeding on other rights Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.

Under this reasoning, a person who comes into the ER is violating a Dr's rights because they owe them a care of duty at this point.

I think we'd get a lot more bang for our buck if we simply treated people before they end up in the emergency room.Regarding rights, why wouldn't your analogy also apply to public education?

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

I suppose I disagree "with one of the most basic declarations of human rights."

A "right" can never include violating someone else's rights.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

The denial of these rights by the people who control them have led to revolution after revolution... some violent and some more of an   evolution   than a revolution.

Those rights are possessed equally, at all times, by all people, under all circumstances, protected equally by government; they can be forfeited only by violating the same rights of another.

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

Fortunately for me, I was born into a society that was founded on individual rights populated by many who are not willing to live under any other system so they chose to defend their rights, physically if necessary.

I suggest you review the fundamental right to life, and the derivative rights liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness.

And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing "imposed" on them is that they not violate my rights.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

A right to health care is not necessary in taking care of sick patients.

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

Single-payer, universal health care results in long waits for patients Canada is a prime example of this.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Health care databases threaten to violate the privacy of patients.'

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

Having patients involved financially in decision making  should help physicians with several discussions.

First, patients often want an expensive diagnostic test.

Second, this strategy would encourage patients to use appropriate generic drugs.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

An average nursing assignment is determined by most facilities to be at 4-5 to ensure safe care for all patients.

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"

Either you should be opposed to fire/police protection and universal healthcare, or should support both.

Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

It's definitely true that no one has a right to healthcare since this would require enslaving someone else to give it to them.

I think healthcare for all is a worthwhile goal.

I want Universal healthcare, but I think it needs to be private.'

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

If such countries are  'deep left' in your view then it suggests that your views are very far to the right.2 "If we already spend a large amount of our gross domestic product on healthcare, then what difference would it make if we switched to a system which would require that we spend even more?"

Let's see if I fully understand the arguments against universal healthcare.1) Healthcare is not a "right".

So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. '

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare.

Should you have to earn being cared for when you randomly develop   cancer  ?No Should you have to earn being able to take your children to the doctor?NoYou can compare healthcare to a police force.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?"

Look at England and the other countries that share our "values" and have made healthcare a universal right.

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected?

Universal healthcare really means universal enslavement, everybody is forced to provide for the needs of everyone else.

there was never a questino regarding abortion or welfare or 'universal healthcare'i just would remind all Americans that " He who can regulate a thing, controls that thing".

Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens?

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

This affects both private and public healthcare.

I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff.

Exactly who are you referring to that you don't want to have healthcare sir?'

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Every European I have met scoffs and is incredulous that we have no universal healthcare and that we pay for university.

Universal healthcare presents an opportunity for the health of all it's citizens.

The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Universal healthcare is not a band-aid, so why should it be treated as such?

Many of the problems are the result of government intrusion into healthcare.

It is not my obligation to pay for the healthcare of others.

Certainly, healthcare isn't an equal right if some are paying for themselves and others, and others are contributing nothing.'

Just in case you don't believe this, ask yourself this... if 51% of the public thought slavery was good, would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights' laws?"

Whether universal health care is analogous to other services is inconsequential.

This is why health must be considered a basic human right.'

If there is a conflict between life and money life should prevail because it is a right while money is a want not a need. '

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

Just look at what has happened with Medicare.'

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

The benefits are far to diverse to pigeon-hole universal health care as just "welfare".'

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

Do large numbers of uninsured give cause to universal health care?

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Similarly, innovations in coordinating care for elders with chronic illness in private plans have provided a useful foundation for care-coordination demonstrations in the public Medicare plan."'

Insurers/conservatives oppose public insurance because it works Robert Reich.

If the program operates well, more and more people will make the rational decision to choose it over private insurance (what we're supposed to do in a market, after all) and the insurance companies will lose customers."'

These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.'

The results of robust private competition to provide the Medicare drug benefit underscore this.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.

Public health care is good; it just receives more scrutiny/criticism Public health care systems receive more scrutiny by the public because they are publicly accountable.

Yet, if we presume that health care is a right, then such added costs are insignificant; they must be born to secure the right of universal health care.'

The 'public option,' if it materializes, will be just that xd1 an option Americans can choose.

Public insurance would destroy private insurance industry Karl Rove.

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

This also explains the drug industryxd5s staunch opposition to single-payer national health insurance."'

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

Health insurance strains on businesses damage global competitiveness '

No universal health care causes "job lock" "The Case for Universal Health Care".

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Free, universal health care would devastate the insurance industry "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?"

Balanced Politics.org - "A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation.

A universal health plan means the entire health insurance industry would be unnecessary.

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

However, any costs not covered by insurance must be absorbed by all the rest of us, which means even higher premiums."'

It must simply read: 'Provide voluntary health insurance for the uninsured.

Just as Americans donxd5t turn people away from hospital emergency rooms, Americans donxd5t leave people behind when it comes to health care insurance."'

Any proposal to shift to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less.... Think maybe if a nation has a lower population then they will naturally be inclined to spend less on healthcare overall?

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

Never in any way can anyone justify government or a group of people to have control over individual rights -  such as one's life (health), one's property (money).  "

There are some facts about those infant mortality statistics that perhaps you should consider...namely, the criteria used to compile them.

If you are aware and read you know our so-called leaders senate/house lie to us and waste our money and vote with the corporations that pay them through PACs (political action committees) having said that here is my plan.

If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.

Should we adopt a version of the Massachusetts plan?We could argue this question as a moral issue.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

Having patients involved financially in decision making  should help physicians with several discussions.

Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.

Second, this strategy would encourage patients to use appropriate generic drugs.

It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.

You are right, Austraila, Canada, and the UK all have universal healthcare.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

If a police officer is near you while you are being attacked, he will obviously intervene because it is his duty.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

Catastrophic care and access to care are certainly issues that should be discussed and acted upon, but not at the cost of the covered.

If our primary business competitors (excepting China) have   health   coverage for all, why don't we?

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

Small businesses can survive for they do not need to pay expensive medical insurance, & can hire more people, more income   taxes  , more buyer of goods, thus, envigorating the economy'

I am a little confused with your point on the single buyer and competition.

Increasing competition between insurance companies will force them to reduce spending and maximize customer base.

With UHC, the businesses out of pocket expenses and payroll costs would go down, making them more productive and remain competitive in global business.Why we will have more qualified   healthcare   providers?

Under the QAPI program, the Secretary shall establish standards relating to such facilities and provide technical assistance to such facilities on the development of best practices in order to meet such standards with quality assessment and assurance activities conducted under clause RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT MONITORAn independent monitor (1) conduct periodic reviews and prepare root- cause quality and deficiency analyses if facilities are in compliance with State and Federal laws and regulations applicable to the facilities; (2) undertake sustained oversight of the facilities to involve the owners of the chain and the principal business owners in facilitating compliance with State and Federal laws and regulations applicable to the facilities; (3) analyze the management structure, distribution of expenditures, and nurse staffing levels of facilities in relation to resident census, staff turnover rates, and tenure.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

1483	There are two possibilities here.

look at it this way, alot of people are dying because they cant afford medical insurance or that they have another helth issue going on.

It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system.

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

And because its immoral it is impractical, as any attempt at socialized medicine around the globe has shown.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

Tyrants, "social justice" totalitarians, humanitarians with a "good cause" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough.

There must be balances to this.

This is the totalitarian premise, the ultimate logical consequence of which is Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany.

Because it is NOT perfectly functioning.

Therefore, since you obviously lean toward socialism in your opinions, the fact that you say you love capitalism is completely hypocritical.

Yes, this is because they have more money, but don't you want your employer to have more money than you so they can afford to pay you?

Each individual can choose their own path to pursue happiness because nobody's path is the same.

If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.

The government does not and should not feed us like mice in a cage.

I used to process Medicare insurance claims, what a joke.

- And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well.

Socialized medicine is a complete disaster all around the world, the more thorough the implementation the more disastarous the results.

there was never a questino regarding abortion or welfare or 'universal healthcare'i just would remind all Americans that " He who can regulate a thing, controls that thing".

We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy. "

Such breaches of the individual liberties of taxpayers are unjust."

The article from the NPA (   http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/it-is-the-patriotic-thing-to-do    ) show that US healthcare is not outstanding compared to other industrialised countries and is rather poor in some respects.'

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.

Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.

(Since it's impossible to know what article you're referring to, there is no way to check the data the reporters used to make sure they're making the right comparisons and drawing the correct inferences; it's not even possible to verify that the WSJ article actually backs your position.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

We must put special interests aside and help our citizens.Health Care is a right.

It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses.

Jesus Christ, you guys are like a broken record.

I'd say Canada's healthcare is the envy of the world because you can have it for free or a cheap on from another country and stuff.

It never said in the Constitution that blacks must remain slaves.

The people who don't want it are the Republicans who think the Gov't is only good for: War, being a thing that is unwanted and over all useless.

Illegal immigrants wound not get the health care because you have to show proof you are a US citizen.

I just got that of the Rasmussen which is considered by most the most accurate.

Every European I have met scoffs and is incredulous that we have no universal healthcare and that we pay for university.

Take Sweden for example, where a person can walk into a hospital at any moment and get treated without the gratuitous amount of paperwork, or questions like, "Who's your insurance carrier?

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

But we're not the worst.As for Katrina, I personally blame Bush for appointing that weirdo as the head of FEMA who probably didn't have any experience in that field at all.

Every other industrialized nation has it, which puts our business at a disadvantage.4.

We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4.

If you think that is socialism, than you are either being very disingenuous or you are incredibly ignorant.

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

Not enough staff is usually the case.

If they provide reduced care (see Canada, Australia, France, Great Britain...) then they can do it for less.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

So I used the same model in to model my Health Care Plan around.We recruit kids out of high school, that have good grades and a interest in the medical field, but because of financial reasons cannot afford to go to College.

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

They derive this belief from two separate, but similar clauses.

However, the federal government must use Article 1, Section 8 to derive their powers.

Finally, because the government sets the prices, inventors and manufacturers of medical equipment will just fade away.

In fact, we all purchase Major Medical Insurance with the Comprehensive Clause added to it.

If they are on the Cigna plan, they will pay a $30 deductible per visit plus 20% which comes to $324.

(hence why i say them) But nice usage of my little ass umption ;) As to your second point.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

There are 30 million people in Canada and this is the reason why Canada is not as prosperous as other capitalist countries.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

It is fallacious to assume that a universal health care system must be more expensive than the present arrangements in the USA.

It is, therefore, not "necessary" for the government to provide universal health care.

You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions. '

Some would argue that health care is a right.

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Blue Cross, Aetna, etc, to a ensure everyone has access to health care.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all."

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

The cost of   health care  .

For sure we should have Universal Healthcare the insurance companies can be in the car, house and life insurance business but not in the   health care   business.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed "universal health care", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise.

If you're going to sit there and say that you think a child does not deserve   health care   because his parents work at Burger King and Walmart, you are disgustingly wrong.

You gladly pay for the health care of   senators   that don't give a crap about you, and millions of other federal employees that don't do a damn thing for you.

You apparently have no problems unless it involves the words "health care".

Will universal health care be run like the US Postal Service, AMTRAK or our public school system?

We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well.

We need universal health care it is a right to have health care not just he wealthy. "

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

I don't think military structured health care is an equitable comparison.

Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

Don't worry, I'm sure there are many visions for universal   health care   in this country.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

It will have a mandate to provide health care, from preventive care through care for serious and chronic illnesses.

And a public insurance plan will invest in health care in our communities."'

if anyone can give all their citizans proper health care its the USA.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

Illegal immigrants wound not get the health care because you have to show proof you are a US citizen.

Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money.

(a) In General- Subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new part:`PART VIII--HEALTH CARE RELATED TAXES`subpart a. tax on individuals without acceptable health care coverage.`Subpart A--Tax on Individuals Without Acceptable Health Care Coverage`Sec.

Tax on individuals without acceptable health care coverage.`SEC.

Such two-tier health care systems already exist in countries with national health care schemes such as the United Kingdom and Germany.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

If you have a segment of the population getting nearly free product (health care int his case) and the rest paying for the product....guess what happens?

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

So, if the government gives people health care, what does the government have to take?

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

Canada pays $5000 a person per year for health care with an estimate that it will cost $7000 in 20 years.

The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.

Using the soviet union isn't the best example, especially when you didn't even note anything on health care policy.

What about all the countries that have universal health care now?

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

I say this because the people in the poverty line can not afford health care.

Free health care isn't "free".

He doesn't have a health care plan.

I just don't see free for all health care happening anytime soon.

And people get served by GOOD doctors, not quacks working for an HMO (which don't exist under universal health care).

It is insane that the US does not have universal health care.

I'm against depending on the government for our health care.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Balanced Politics.org - "Government-mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Under this reasoning, a person who comes into the ER is violating a Dr's rights because they owe them a care of duty at this point.

But even if a public option available to all takes the highly improbable step of paying at some midpoint between private and Medicare rates, nearly 68 million people will still be crowded out of private insurance."'

And this is just a ridiculous statement to appeal to emotion.The only other point I think needs a response is your tactless criticism of capitalism.

Let's suppose for the sake of the discussion, that "point" is 24 hours.

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

And even now, it is more expensive to get health insurance for people who smoke, or who are overweight, then people who don't or aren't.My point being...What happens when the government takes over healthcare.

I am a little confused with your point on the single buyer and competition.

It won't matter if they skip an appointment, they're covered if something bad happens.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

As I explicitly pointed out earlier, money is a symbol.

Provided you're not a complete douche (which is the point of why it's not altruism to look out for your neighbor, but is actually done in self-interest).

The points made in this article sound very nice on the surface.

Let's be creative and allow privatization, but not to the point that we have become, so that health care is exclusively for the wealthy.

Whether universal health care is analogous to other services is inconsequential.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Will require additional travel to acquire medical services, especially specialty services?

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.
