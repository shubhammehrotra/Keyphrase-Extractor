Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.

Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness.

Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.

Therefore, in countries where the population is aging, it may be important to avoid a universal health care program."

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

What government pays for becomes the reasonable standard of care, a standard that can be debated democratically at appropriations time for the health care budget rather than haggled for erratically in the courts."'

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

Better technologies and treatments in private health care aids prevention.

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness.

For those that will contract illnesses or cancers regardless of any preventative measures they take, such high-end treatment is welcome. "

Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.

June 27, 2009: "Which raises the question: Would the existence of a dominant government provider of health insurance be good or bad?

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

It won't matter if they skip an appointment, they're covered if something bad happens.

If you have never dealt with these issues, you simply can't imagine how bad it is, I'm not exagerating, ask around.

Too bad you have to wait for the particular ambulance to be available while you have your heart attack.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Public health insurance offers citizens more choices Jacob Hacker.

Universal health care protects healthy citizens from many health risks.

If citizens have a right to be healthy, they are due some protections from the sickly.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens?

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

We must put special interests aside and help our citizens.Health Care is a right.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Universal healthcare presents an opportunity for the health of all it's citizens.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

The number of uninsured citizens has grown to over 40 million.

Tyrants, "social justice" totalitarians, humanitarians with a "good cause" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough.

A cigarette tax is a socially responsible way to pay for health care'

De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.

If that argument holds water for you then I'd suggest reading up the utilitarian arguments for capitalism and the free market."

And this is just a ridiculous statement to appeal to emotion.The only other point I think needs a response is your tactless criticism of capitalism.

AKA capitalism benefits the majority of people (and that's the best we can hope for)."

(the stage following capitalism in the transition of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles - dictionary.com)'

Therefore, since you obviously lean toward socialism in your opinions, the fact that you say you love capitalism is completely hypocritical.

Here, let me provide you with this handy visual aide:[socialism]----------------------------2--1----------[capitalism] 1 = Where we are now2 = What Democrats want'

will u tell me the difference between socialism and capitalism?'

It maintains the good properties of capitalism as there would still be the exact same incentives to come up with new cures and the free market is still free to compete.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

No universal health care causes "job lock" "The Case for Universal Health Care".

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Balanced Politics.org - "A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation.

This is a highly disruptive act that would involve massive job loss.

If you make it to 18, we might have some jobs for you, thanks to your high school diploma.Cuba has better infant and maternal mortality rates than us, for Pete's sake.

If you don't like the fact that a particular company hires people you donxd5t approve of (moving jobs across seas), you are free to protest by refusing to buy their products.

For example look at the wonderful job they do with FEMA.

I want to earn enough money that I don't have to keep struggling to find a better job...

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

I'm a Viet Nam vet currently on my wife's insurance, so I'm happy with the system as long as my wife keeps her job.

A government is not truly doing its job if it is not taking care of its people."

I have 2 jobs, but I don't even get more than $1000 every month.

Man, it's the government's job to protect the people.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

High taxes create less jobs and innovations.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

As for a moral obligation - we have already, as a society, decided it is best for eeryone if we pay for every child's education.

It then becomes in their best interest to "take care of you" and they begin to say, you must take a 10 minute break every two hours, and you must arm stretches, or rest your eyes from looking at your computer monitor, or whatever it may be.

AKA capitalism benefits the majority of people (and that's the best we can hope for)."

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

Move to Cuba haaaaa....How about this, If America is the greatest country they should have the best Health care.

Using the soviet union isn't the best example, especially when you didn't even note anything on health care policy.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

Whatxd5s interesting here is that you would actually use the example of public education to justify socialized medicine.

Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D. "The case for public plan choice in national health reform".

And because its immoral it is impractical, as any attempt at socialized medicine around the globe has shown.

(hence why i say them) But nice usage of my little ass umption ;) As to your second point.

People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better.

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

If you make it to 18, we might have some jobs for you, thanks to your high school diploma.Cuba has better infant and maternal mortality rates than us, for Pete's sake.

France is often cited as high tax hell.

They cannot be treated the same because society benefits more from the doctor's life than the murderer's.Free market economy is fair and just.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

And, of course, one cannot pursue happiness if they are in a hospital bed.

If there is a conflict between life and money life should prevail because it is a right while money is a want not a need. '

But do people who don't drive recklessly ask for money back when roads are damaged?

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Securing one right by impeding on other is illegitimate.'

For instance - would it be equal if no one had access to MRI's?

After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor.

Canada residents will often go to the U.S. or offer additional money to get their health care needs taken care of."'

What we need is to get government out of our wallets so people can have their own money needed to purchase and own their own health insurance."'

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

But, what is likely to make the most money is often at odds with public and patient interests. '

This can and should be done, but it is unnecessary to inject into the equation a public insurer.'

Government may set one standard of health care, but it may be inferior.

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

Reducing profit, reduces motive and the money necessary to get a drug through FDA trials.

It's definitely true that no one has a right to healthcare since this would require enslaving someone else to give it to them.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

As I explicitly pointed out earlier, money is a symbol.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Provided you're not a complete douche (which is the point of why it's not altruism to look out for your neighbor, but is actually done in self-interest).

Yes, this is because they have more money, but don't you want your employer to have more money than you so they can afford to pay you?

But you gladly give your money up for roads you do not travel on,   water   you do not drink, garbage that isn't yours, libraries you will never enter, etcetera etcetera etcetera.

If a person chooses to contribute to society, they receive money in return.

I want to have enough money to go on vacations and spend time with my future family.

I want enough money to afford to donate to organizations I think are worthy and not corrupt.

I want to earn enough money that I don't have to keep struggling to find a better job...

That's all..... and it's a very easy argument to make and a hard one to argue against.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine.'

First you start with a dishonest heading: "Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System" Then you admit within the first couple of sentences that the title is nonsense.

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing "imposed" on them is that they not violate my rights.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

Police officers are a requirement, Ambulance drivers are a necessity, Fire Departments are an essential service all funded by public money.

Why can't we buy health insurance from another state if it is cheaper?Here is a great article that I suggest should everyone read.

They are going to take money away from Medicare:Ignoring that Medicare is a government program and the naysayers should be all for taking money away from medicare - if they were basing their arguements on principle at least - this is not true either.

Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?'

if anyone can give all their citizans proper health care its the USA.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

But, altogether, it is not my responsibility to "make up" for anyone elses well being.

The Institute for America's Future: "over the last generation, public insurance has pioneered new payment and quality-improvement methods that have frequently set the standard for private plans.

This is, unfortunately, one of the downfalls of trying to debate US politics when not actually American.

Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

In this country, if you have no money, you don't get a good insurance plan which is not fair.

The country would either take more and more of its citizen's money, or become trillions and trillions more dollars in debt."

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4.

It can't be done right.

This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials.

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Well I'm glad you have done so, what you get from unemployment is less that 50% of your total monthly income when you were employed and this is on top of not receiving insurance.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better.

Realism won that one again.

As a Christian, I am all for charity and think the church needs to step up to that far better than it has done so, but forced payment on my part removes that possibility.

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

Balanced Politics.org - "A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation.

Since health care premiums continue to grow at several times the rate of inflation, many businesses are simply choosing to not offer a health plan, or if they do, to pass on more of the cost to employees.

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

Many lessons learned can be obtained if we take a deeper look at the   evolution   of the NHS in the UK.

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

They will end up paying less percentage wise than their secretaries...   and they'll even admit it.

You apparently have no problems unless it involves the words "health care".

Will expensive bureaucratic government employees be more efficient than less expensive private insurance employees?

The poor and powerless need help in this country you should get out more!!'

This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it."

Their governments have simply made an arbitrary decision to spend less, but they will also get less."

The people who don't want it are the Republicans who think the Gov't is only good for: War, being a thing that is unwanted and over all useless.

Individuals and families earning less than these amounts will be eligible for subsidies paid directly to their insurer.xd3This is absolute crap.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Public insurance option is less costly than private insurance "Why The Public Health Insurance Option Is Worth Fighting For".

If they provide reduced care (see Canada, Australia, France, Great Britain...) then they can do it for less.

Yet a range of studies demonstrate that public insurance is able to provide a given level of benefits for less than they would cost through private insurance.

Combined, this needless administration consumes one-third (31 percent) of Americansxd5 health dollars.

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Well I'm glad you have done so, what you get from unemployment is less that 50% of your total monthly income when you were employed and this is on top of not receiving insurance.

High taxes create less jobs and innovations.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

I want to give them shots at being blessed just like me.

But in our judgment, if that many Americans were to decide that such a plan is a better deal for them and their families, that would be a good thing.

Free, universal health care would devastate the insurance industry "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?"

And this is just a ridiculous statement to appeal to emotion.The only other point I think needs a response is your tactless criticism of capitalism.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

(  http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/steal  )I do not give permission nor do you have a right to my property as is stated in the Constitution.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

Under socialism there are no individuals, only meaningless cogs whose obligation is to serve the collective as prescribed by the omnipotent state.  "

I also think we should be entitled to the same things as were our founding fathers.This country was founded on the principles that stated "You have the right to work hard, and you are entitled to exactly those things which you earn.

Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.

Why can't we buy health insurance from another state if it is cheaper?Here is a great article that I suggest should everyone read.

AKA capitalism benefits the majority of people (and that's the best we can hope for)."

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

This means that a single-payer health care system would not see a major reduction in funding for medical innovation.

This also explains the drug industryxd5s staunch opposition to single-payer national health insurance."'

Any proposal to shift to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry.

Whatever gives us the best health care to everyone for our buck, that's our choice.A single-payer system is what almost all of the rest of the industrialized world has.

It is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system, but there are just as many advocates of a hybrid system.

Public option is really about making way for a single-payer system Gregory Mankiw.

During the presidential campaign, he said, 'If I were designing a system from scratch, I would probably go ahead with a single-payer system.'"'

The government does not and should not feed us like mice in a cage.

The Government doesn't own us, so therefore it shouldn't have to take care of us like our mother did.'

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

Without health care, the poor are more vulnerable and have a harder time achieving their goals.

50 Gs is enough to put middle or lower class person into debt with ease.

As most people know, most doctor's visits end with "take this and call me if it doesn't get better" which should hardly be seen as "preventative" of anything.'

If you have more money you can get better insurance so someone that earns alot of money should be able to pay for better heatlh care then some bum off the streets.'

You might look at the 22 to 35 percent of the cut the insurance companies take out of the costs.Medicare runs only a 4 to 6 percent overhead.My parents on Medicare, get better care than I do and I spend over 16,00 dollars per year on insurance.I favor nationalized health care.... or at least a single payer system.

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

I may not be thrilled with the expense of my current PPO plan, but it's a MILLION times better than what I experienced in the military system. "

The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like.

I'm a Viet Nam vet currently on my wife's insurance, so I'm happy with the system as long as my wife keeps her job.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

I have repeatedly stated that I am for gay marriage but that I did not believe that the current approach the gay community was taking was going to succeed.

If you oppose Universal Healthcare, what about the current system do you think works well?

Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business.

Thats what are current ratio is.

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"

One of the interesting things that popped out to me was the projected deficit increase in billions.

It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.

But, this is unfair and contrary to the higher moral principles upon which societies should be founded.

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business because they are unsure of whether they can get health insurance on the individual market, which has higher premiums and often denies people with pre-existing conditions."'

However, any costs not covered by insurance must be absorbed by all the rest of us, which means even higher premiums."'

Call is socialised medicine if you will, but the universal health schemes of Canada, Great Britain and Australia cost less and the people in these countries have a higher average life expectancy than the USA.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

I don't have to actually read the primary sources myself because the fact is that I don't want to be tax at a higher rate, period.Here's how it should work.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

Government-control of databases better protect privacy than companies.

Will expensive bureaucratic government employees be more efficient than less expensive private insurance employees?

There are 30 million people in Canada and this is the reason why Canada is not as prosperous as other capitalist countries.

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

Millions more impoverished americans who have insurance but can barely afford it are also harmed by the current health care plan.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

But the millions of Americans who are tired of increasing costs and decreasing benefits should have the chance to opt into a program that will offer affordable, quality care, says Health Care for America Now's Richard Kirsch."'

They cannot be treated the same because society benefits more from the doctor's life than the murderer's.Free market economy is fair and just.

The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.

Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices.

Yet a range of studies demonstrate that public insurance is able to provide a given level of benefits for less than they would cost through private insurance.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).

April 13, 2009: "As people gravitate to 'free' or heavily subsidized care, the inevitably explosive costs will be covered in part with increased outlays to keep premiums artificially low or even offer extra benefits.

By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance.

I want to have enough money to go on vacations and spend time with my future family.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Whether universal health care is analogous to other services is inconsequential.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009)."'

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

For example, governments, such as Canada, have outlawed medical care if the service is paid for by private individual funds.'
