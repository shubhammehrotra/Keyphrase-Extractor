Do you want to be FORCED to get something done just cause the government papers says you should.

After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor.

Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health.

So if you take the wrong legal drug you can go to the doctor and get help not thrown in jail to be raped and have you future life destroyed by our greedy out of control so called leader house/senate.

For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009)."'

Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.

An important part of the evidence takes the form of international comparisons.

I have presented evidence that suggests that universal health schemes work out cheaper.

which include dietary choices,Where is your evidence that Americans make different dietary choices to Canadians, Australians and the British?

We only have to look here in our own country to see evidence of that.

The myth that "bipartisan" legislation works better than partisan legislation is widespread, but virtually no real evidence supports it.

Government-funded universal health care would violate patient privacy - Sue Blevins.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

Universal health care will have rules that decrease patient flexibility "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?"

Balanced Politics.org - "Government-controlled health care would lead to a decrease in patient flexibility.

A right to health care is not necessary in taking care of sick patients.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.

For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs - Health insurance claims are considered a "loss" for profit insurance companies.

Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health.

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

Universal health care allows investments in longer-term patient relationships.

Balanced Politics.org - "Government-mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care.

But, what is likely to make the most money is often at odds with public and patient interests. '

Single-payer, universal health care results in long waits for patients Canada is a prime example of this.

Universal health care lowers long-term health costs Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.

A universal health care system will help coordinate and reduce paperwork, allowing doctors to concentrate on treating patients.

Creating a new administrative framework and patient database would be a massive under-taking.'

Balanced Politics.org - "A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation.

Health care databases threaten to violate the privacy of patients.'

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.

Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.

Having patients involved financially in decision making  should help physicians with several discussions.

First, patients often want an expensive diagnostic test.

Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.

Second, this strategy would encourage patients to use appropriate generic drugs.

June 11, 2009: "the public option puts government firmly in the middle of the relationship between patients and their doctors.

- And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.

The simple answers are:  Because our standards are high; Because in addition to the actual cost of the medical care administered to paying patients, added are the cost of lawyersxd5, courtsxd5 and insurance fees, government imposed   taxes  , FDA regulations adherence fees, illegal non-paying immigrant medical expenses, etc.

They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims.

Doctors, patients, everyone.Get rid of the unnecessary overhead, get insurance companies out of medicine.'

medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

An average nursing assignment is determined by most facilities to be at 4-5 to ensure safe care for all patients.

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor.

Indications from the Medicare Advantage experience suggest that, if anything, private plans would most likely be favored over a public plan.

Socializing anything involves taking individual decisions and "socializing" any negative effects to the community instead of limiting it to the individual.'

As most people know, most doctor's visits end with "take this and call me if it doesn't get better" which should hardly be seen as "preventative" of anything.'

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Greed is the main motivator for both actions so do not listen to the lies see the movie and listen to the real people that have nothing to gain by lying about the system.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Sorry boss, I couldn't find anything our government does well.

Do you want to be FORCED to get something done just cause the government papers says you should.

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

[...] A public plan does nothing to advance on this.

But for all the scare tactics out there, whatxd5s truly scary xd1 truly risky xd1 is the prospect of doing nothing.

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

June 11, 2009: "Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance.

Universal health care protects healthy citizens from many health risks.

If citizens have a right to be healthy, they are due some protections from the sickly.

However, a single-payer health plan would eliminate that option and all citizens would be forced to give up their ability to maintain a confidential doctor-patient relationship.

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens?

And he could still feed his family.Every industrialized country in the world (except the US) provides their citizens with free health care.

We must put special interests aside and help our citizens.Health Care is a right.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Universal healthcare presents an opportunity for the health of all it's citizens.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

The number of uninsured citizens has grown to over 40 million.

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

Rather should we develop a minimal health coverage that all should have.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.

Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?"

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

- And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.

When a hospital writes off a bill who pays?

It's a lie aimed at a specific group of people to get them riled against the bill.3.

I've always been in favor of some type of Socialized medicine in the country but I think with all the fighting going on at town halls and such it's hard to know what the bill's attributes are at this point.

I would a whole lot rather my hard earned money go towards paying the health bills of smokers and fatties than illegal aliens that don't pay one red cent, for any dime they make, towards taxes.

224 (p. 118) provides that 18 months after the bill becomes law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what a "qualified plan" covers and how much you'll be legally required to pay for it.

One of the interesting things that popped out to me was the projected deficit increase in billions.

Could you provide a link to the correct bill for me please?'

We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4.

We know that premiums in the public option would be about 10 percent lower and that a real robust plan that piggy backs off of Medicarexd5s infrastructure could save us somewhere between $75 billion and $150 billion over 10 years."'

If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donxd5t have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest).

The costs of doctor's consultation, medical tests, operations, equipments, hospitals, utilities will be in billions of dollars.

After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor.

That's where everything's made anyway.

As for everything else in your comment, you've lost me.

You make everything sound so black and white, news flash......its not!!'

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

Why we donxd5t need itMost people have this idea that if they donxd5t have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

Will individuals get to choose to pay or not to pay?Everyone keeps saying it's like medicare but I hate the concept of medicare...'

Universal care would protect doctors/hospitals from free-loaders Uncompensated care is a problem for hospitals and doctors.

The costs of doctor's consultation, medical tests, operations, equipments, hospitals, utilities will be in billions of dollars.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

Universal health care decreases the likelihood of health related problems.

People would be more likely to see a doctor for preventive care than seeing a doctor later with serious   health   problems, which are the most expensive.

I think there are some small ways to fix all of these problems without going to UHC.

Thatxd5s why health insurers deny care to people with pre-existing conditions, charge more if you have any history of even minor health problems and deny and delay approving care.

I think we need to focus on the actual issue, which is health care in this country and not wander off in the direction of education, which while it is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed and has lasting effects perhaps even in regards to our health care system it doesn't mean that the system itself shouldn't be changed.'	0	0.0037833366077393293

Many of the problems are the result of government intrusion into healthcare.

Of course, equally important is that we start living healthier lifestyles, but, one thing at a time, I guess?'

Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

I don't want to live under your ideal of freedom and liberty to all (if you can afford it).

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.

What we need is to get government out of our wallets so people can have their own money needed to purchase and own their own health insurance."'

I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a "right.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Modern collectivism merely replaces a supernatural God as that power with some group called the "proletariat", "society", "the masses", the "master race", etc., to which the individual is subordinate, and which leads logically to totalitarianism.

Single-payer health care allows bargaining for lower drug prices "Single-Payer FAQ".

Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices.

Finally, because the government sets the prices, inventors and manufacturers of medical equipment will just fade away.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

[...] Once everyone is required [by mandates] to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines.

Single-payer systems create new job opportunities Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry. '

I have 2 jobs, but I don't even get more than $1000 every month.

I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?).

As for what governments do well, or at least less badly, that would depend on your point of view.

So, provide healthcare for all get them well and get rid of welfare to help balance the cost of healthcare. '

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

Government can save more   money   by paying healthcare provider that encourage wellness and preventive care, than paying them for diagnostic test and procedures that are useless, painful and expensive.

Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs.

There are public-private hybrids as well, like state employee health plans where the government assumes the risk and insurance companies are responsible for the management.

We already have   universal health care   It just doesn't work very well.

But, altogether, it is not my responsibility to "make up" for anyone elses well being.

If you oppose Universal Healthcare, what about the current system do you think works well?

The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage.

2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: "A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage.

I also am deeply concerned that single payer coverage will further restrict patients access to a more integrative health care approach, including freedom of choice, full access to health and wellness coverage.  '

The Case Against: The public plan will unfairly crowd out private coverage.

The Institute for America's Future: "As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan.

De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.

Rather should we develop a minimal health coverage that all should have.

So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?

I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.

Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.

They would go out of business and then we're all screwed.The solution is to reduce the regulations already on insurance companies as well as encourage true competition for   health   coverage.

Health coverage would cost more for unhealthier people.

Perhaps the US will copy California....As for your comments comparing the   police   with   health   coverage, there is a difference between protection from others and protection from death by natural causes.

If our primary business competitors (excepting China) have   health   coverage for all, why don't we?

If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?

http://select.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/opinion/21kristof.html?scp=5&sq=kristof  +infant+mortality+rate&st=nyt18,000 Americans die every year because of a lack of   health   coverage.

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

I'm no authority but I've seen enough to say universal is the way this country will go and should go.

If there is a conflict between life and money life should prevail because it is a right while money is a want not a need. '

Universal health care helps them get the care that they need.

The main premises here is that "rights" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable.

These individuals need health insurance more than the health care industry needs a level playing field to continue its high profits.'

Canada residents will often go to the U.S. or offer additional money to get their health care needs taken care of."'

Free, universal health care helps the unhealthy in times of need.

Society should strive to defend and care for the needy and vulnerable, instead of subjecting them to a system that punishes them for their disadvantages.'

And, of course, this model can be expanded out further, if need be, to aid the needy.'

What we need is to get government out of our wallets so people can have their own money needed to purchase and own their own health insurance."'

Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and "high-risk".

These are the people that need health care the most, and the insurance industry has a direct interest in making it difficult or more expensive for them to obtain health insurance.'

I don't need a math lesson, you need a comprehension lesson.

If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.

In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals.

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

How is health care any different?All rights are based on needs.

June 11, 2009: "Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

I agree, but I'm also wondering what people think needs to improve?

America has more malpractice suits than any other country, which means that our doctors need to be heavily insured.

Urban Institute: "The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive.

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

Single-payer health care is "socialized medicine" Lenin said, "medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

But, what is likely to make the most money is often at odds with public and patient interests. '

This can and should be done, but it is unnecessary to inject into the equation a public insurer.'

Government may set one standard of health care, but it may be inferior.

Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.

Reducing profit, reduces motive and the money necessary to get a drug through FDA trials.

Of course people's lifestyles and the crime rates have an effect on longevity, but I'm amazed that anyone could even suggest that Americans have worse health outcomes because of genetics.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

If you are aware and read you know our so-called leaders senate/house lie to us and waste our money and vote with the corporations that pay them through PACs (political action committees) having said that here is my plan.

Therefore, I will try to make my point another way.UHC will be funded by   taxes  .Taxes are paid by everyone (unequally, the rich paying a higher percentage).Everyone will not be using the same amount of   health care  .Therefore, some people will be paying more than their share and some will be paying less.This is unequal and unfair and WRONG.Also, health care should not be free for anyone ever.

As I explicitly pointed out earlier, money is a symbol.

1791	Morality ends where a gun begins"- Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism...the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good...that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.

Tyrants, "social justice" totalitarians, humanitarians with a "good cause" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough.

That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do.'

Provided you're not a complete douche (which is the point of why it's not altruism to look out for your neighbor, but is actually done in self-interest).

Yes, this is because they have more money, but don't you want your employer to have more money than you so they can afford to pay you?

But you gladly give your money up for roads you do not travel on,   water   you do not drink, garbage that isn't yours, libraries you will never enter, etcetera etcetera etcetera.

If a person chooses to contribute to society, they receive money in return.

First you start with a dishonest heading: "Single-Payer Systems Do Not Cost Less Than the U.S. Health Care System" Then you admit within the first couple of sentences that the title is nonsense.

That means health care spending is a political decision, not a medical one.

Big medicine does not want universal health care they would lose too much money. "

And ensure yourself that my having these rights in no way imposes any action or duty or requirements on anyone else, the only thing "imposed" on them is that they not violate my rights.

Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people.

Since I am a veteran, I have access to the VA, where I still receive government run health care, which is a benefit to me because it saves me a lot of money.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

In this country, if you have no money, you don't get a good insurance plan which is not fair.

The country would either take more and more of its citizen's money, or become trillions and trillions more dollars in debt."

Screwed completely.The government isn't going to go door to door and jack people's money, they're going to use taxes to pay for universal health care, if that's a problem then we might as well forget taxes completely so you can look at privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere(They already exist, but in small numbers), schools with little to no funding, and a fee for absolutely everything.I guess universal school care is also stealing money from one person and giving it to another, but nobody seems to care about that right?

We just have to get away from this mentality that someone else should pay our bills.4.

It can't be done right.

These duplicated costs can be eliminated with a single payer system.3) In countries with universal health care, the government spends less tax money per person on health care than the U.S. For example, in France, the government spends $569 less per person on health care than in the United States.

People talk about how taxes would be higher well taxes are killing people too so at least if they were somewhere they could not worry about having to deal with one more thing perhaps the US would be a little better.

Nearly 100 providers deliver the drug benefit, competing on better benefits, more choices, and lower prices.

Yet a range of studies demonstrate that public insurance is able to provide a given level of benefits for less than they would cost through private insurance.

Universal health care doesn't have to mean giving up the benefits of capitalism.

The doctor gets paid through the ministry of health either directly or via insurance companies (like work benefits).

April 13, 2009: "As people gravitate to 'free' or heavily subsidized care, the inevitably explosive costs will be covered in part with increased outlays to keep premiums artificially low or even offer extra benefits.

By way of illustration, between 1997 and 2006, health spending per enrollee (for comparable benefits) grew at 4.6 percent a year under Medicare, compared with 7.3 percent a year under private health insurance.

But the millions of Americans who are tired of increasing costs and decreasing benefits should have the chance to opt into a program that will offer affordable, quality care, says Health Care for America Now's Richard Kirsch."'

Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.

Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided. '

Universal health care is not welfare; its benefits are diverse/widespread Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.

The markets are better at providing quality; same with health care.

Government-mandated procedures would reduce doctor flexibility/quality "Should the Government Provide Free Universal Health Care for All Americans?"

But the millions of Americans who are tired of increasing costs and decreasing benefits should have the chance to opt into a program that will offer affordable, quality care, says Health Care for America Now's Richard Kirsch."'

The Institute for America's Future: "Public plan choice creates an institutional xd2check and balance,xd3 encouraging private plans to uphold high standards of quality, affordability, and access."'

Besides, where will all the Canadians go to for quality healthcare if it goes national here?"

These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.tThe fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.tThe number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.tCost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseasexc9)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.tChronic Disease 2.tCatastrophic Care3.tEnd of Life Care4.tPediatric Care5.tEnd of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.tThe invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.tHealth Care IT will need to improve to allow interoperability and clinical data consolidation to allow data aggregation and mining to help manage Chronic Disease Management, Personal Health Records & Enable Community Health / Lifestyle Health Management3.tHome Health / Tele-Monitoring (Cost Control)4.tPersonalized Medicine (Genomic Medicine / Molecular Prevention)5.tQuality to Quantitative   medicine   evolution'

If that doesn't pay enough, I will strive to be a research director for a biomedical   technology   company to design and test biomedical devices to increase the quality of life for many people.

The Institute for America's Future: "over the last generation, public insurance has pioneered new payment and quality-improvement methods that have frequently set the standard for private plans.

Public health insurance creates two-tiers of quality.

Privately insured Americans would get higher quality health care, but because the market for medical innovation would be smaller, everybody will get worse care than they would otherwise have received had most health care not been nationalized."'

The right to life means nobody else can   murder   you.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Universal health care encourages people to seek preventive treatments because it is free.

Better technologies and treatments in private health care aids prevention.

Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.

These treatments can be a part of prevention or early treatment, and can have better results than what exists in universal health care systems. '

Higher-end treatment is important; sometimes you can't prevent illness.

For those that will contract illnesses or cancers regardless of any preventative measures they take, such high-end treatment is welcome. "

Balanced Politics.org - "We can develop a centralized national database which makes diagnosis and treatment easier for doctors.

Life span and birth rates are just statistical gimmicks that are influenced by too many factors to be useful in this context.Universal health care does not mean the poorest and sickest will get medical treatment, at best it means that if they manage find a doctor and survive while waiting then someone else will pay for it....

The insurance companies have already usurped the doctors by mandating treatments, while leaving the docs liable for the legal ramifications of their practice.

A system that leaves people on the street rather than meeting their basic human needs is tragic and should be condemned for such treatment.

It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments.

/> Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light; currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs"

Whether universal health care is analogous to other services is inconsequential.

People should pay only for health services they themselves receive Why should one person pay for the health services of another person?

For example, Medicare Advantage plans are paid percent more than Medicare fee-for-service in 2009 for the average beneficiary, clear evidence that traditional Medicare has not always been favored (MedPAC 2009)."'

Also, charity health services would not have enough equipment and funds to treat expensive, life-threatening diseases like cancers.'

Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.

If a person is "rationed out" of the public health care service (perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention) they will be able seek alternative treatment in the private sector.

Universal health care creates dependencies on government Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.

This will attract consumers who require either more personal service, those who know or want a personal doctor, and those who want better quality of care than the public system provides."

Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.

For example, governments, such as Canada, have outlawed medical care if the service is paid for by private individual funds.'

Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.

Will require additional travel to acquire medical services, especially specialty services?

More qualified   healthcare   workers will be selected to provide the services and it will cut down on paperwork, that justify the expenses to insurance companies.

They screen procedures, tests, medicines and services administered to the insured patients, and screen and pay insurance claims.

Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.

Police officers are a requirement, Ambulance drivers are a necessity, Fire Departments are an essential service all funded by public money.

Also Republicans are backed by these giant health care companies that give them and people they like better service and money for lobbying for them.

That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.xd3You pay a tax to support a service.

The Government can't afford the services it pays for now, cause it has no control over the costs of drugs and what Hospitals and Doctors charge.As I said under my plan we control costs and improve care."

The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. An estimated 84.7% of citizens have some form of health insurance coverage, either through their employer, purchased individually, or through government sources.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets.

If your body is slowly being attacked by cancer (an attacker), the doctor (officer) does not need to intervene if you don't have insurance.So if you agree with the above statement, you would also agree that you should have to pay insurance for police, and if you didn't have insurance, the police wouldn't have to help you if you were being attacked.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the UN, states that healthcare is a basic human RIGHT.
