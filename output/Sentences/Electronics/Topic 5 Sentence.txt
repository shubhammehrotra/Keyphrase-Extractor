It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations.

After that you can buy books with your credit card if everything works perfect which it never does.

While you will not find any reference to the problem on the B&N; site a Google search on "Barnes and Noble Simple Touch W-Fi problems" or a similar search, will give you a better feel for Simiple Touch owners who are struggling.

What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.

However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires.

I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen.

I do not buy anything that is not fully touch screen if it can be.

You MUST tie a credit card to your B&N; account or you can't buy anything including FREE books!3.

My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

There is no "period", or "dot", in the numerical keyboard, so it is not possible to enter another url, either to make a purchase from another bookseller, or, more importantly from my point of view, to log on to the local library (this would appear to apply to local US libraries as well; what a waste of WiFi!).

Two points only:1) The ereader device is wonderful2) DO NOT purchase ebooks from B&N; as they contain additional security restrictions that make it extremely difficult / not possible to compile into Adobe Digital Edition for transfer to other ereader devices.

If you are interested in reading you will not be dissapointed!My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that I wish there were more books available that I could share.

Learning point: never order something online in the "My Nook - My Library" and expect to actually read it.I also do not like the way that newspapers and magazines are presented.

I got excuses like: they warehouse is busy, and you have to send yours back first (even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back).At this point, I don't even want it anymore.

However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.

Wifi Connectivity:What the **** is the point of having wifi if you can only use it for downloading purchases from B&N.

Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources.

My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.

Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default.

You can toggle this feature on & off, and there is an Amazon site that lets you view readers' highlighting for ANY book--not just the books you own.

Since there are page-turn buttons, it would be helpful if the Nook had a feature to temporarily disable the touch screen.

Kindle is a step forward with this "most have" feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness.

But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

You must delete every thing all at once and start from empty all over again.A very bad feature nook should change as soon as possible.The saving grace is the large 500 book capacity of the nook and the slot to install a 32 gb flash drive memory stick so that nook can hold 1000 books.

Also, I've heard that you get free coupons and even occasionally a free book when you enter B&N; -- haven't gotten to try that feature out yet, my campus bookstore isn't officially a real B&N;, but I'm looking forward to it.Wifi: the Nook doesn't generate its own hotspot, but considering that practically everywhere you're going to go is jumping on the wifi bandwagon you shouldn't need one.

B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.

Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.

I wish they would offer a silicone frame for it, because the cover I have for it adds more weight.

I will say that a cover really isn't necessary, the Simple Touch front has a rubberized frame that invites you to use without a cover though you might just want to use a cover for protection when you're not reading.

* Amazon has slightly better paid ebook coverage than does B&N;, and Kindle ebooks are often cheaper than Nook ebooks.

If you want a great ereader with no real flaws, the latest in ereader technology, an extraordinary battery life, and an easy to use interface than this is the ereader to get.I was stuck between the kindle touch and a nook simple touch but I chose the nook because it displays books better (has pictures and the actual book covers instead of just the title in words) and the Touch screen is a lot more responsive on the Nook Simple Touch than on the kindle touch.

Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.

However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.

If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.

And please, Amazon and B&N;, work hard on making sure that e-books are device agnostic in the future.

The nook seems to work great now that I can use it, but using barnes and noble for you ebooks might not be the best idea.

What I like about Nook (so far):-easy to use-has a memory card slot for more storage capacity-light and convenient to carry around-very good for a basic readerWhat I don't like:-sometimes the display appears fadedAll in all, I'm liking my new Nook.

This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N; or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.

)Menu / keyboard items are not scalableNo parental filters / controlsNo on board method to manage files or memory usageThe small screen size decreases reading continuity at larger text sizes; no ability to view text in LandscapeApparently, Amazon really prefers you buy the Kindle, observing they are offering the NOOK for $40 more than for the price it is offered at Barnes and Noble.Summary:I own a Kindle and a NOOK Touch.

Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.

I did have to "help" some of them,  but that was easy too, requiring just a touch on the download prompt.The touch keypad is larger and easier to use than on the 1st Gen, although with "fat fingers" or poor hand control,  a stylus makes a nice aid.Someone in another review forum said that the Simple Touch lacks the ability to highlight and make notes.

It's so much easier to look up the meaning of a word, you can have a wish list for books you want to buy, which you can't do on the old one.

I love it and would suggest it for anyone looking at purchasing an e reader.

Would be interesting to see a report from someone that knows specifics about the software shop that developed the Nook Simple Touch code.

The eReader UI experience should be closer to an iPhone experience, instead of a VCR timer event recording from the 80's (like it is).

I wish they would offer a silicone frame for it, because the cover I have for it adds more weight.

Searching for the best matching one, I've found 2 interesting: Barnes & Noble Nook Touch and Kobo Touch.

The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour.Well, as a gift for my doughter, Nook Touch is perfect, small, light and stylish.

The Nook is definitely worth the money, even though it costs considerably more than a book would.

Just as you reach that stage, the call is terminated with a statement that the transfer cannot be completed and you get the dialling tone.

$10 cheaper than anyone else.

From this one user's experience: if you go with Nook, hope that you won't need their customer service.

(If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?)

The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.

So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).

although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another.

Looking up a word in the dictionary can be accessed only through the touch screen and it is always responsive, BUT it might be frustrating for someone with big fingers because touching the screen and highlighting the intended word to look up might result with the device highlighting the word above or below it.

Kindle is a step forward with this "most have" feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness.

There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself.

I would highly recommend this item to anyone just wanting an e-reader it's great!!

Honestly, that USB download process is buggy too.

When you buy a Nook, you cannot assume to use it unless someone has told you ahead of time that the purchase, unlike any other electronic device, does not include a charger.

I would deffinately recommend it to any one who just wants to read.

They were so inexpensive I got one for me & one for my wife.I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great.

Great tool for education, and I highly recommend Nook for anyone.

Consider to buy an additional memory card to increase the capacity of this device and to buy it from BluProton seller, they have one of the finest and most efficient services worldwide.

this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader .

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that.

4 stars because it's really easy to use, you can find a lot of books the battery lasts for about 2-3 weeks (and i read about 6 hours a day at least).The only disadvantage is that maybe i could use a little bigger screen.But in general it's worth it's money!

Yet at Band N if you walk in, the same Nook is priced at $79 and you get a $20 gift card if you buy one .

I have an iPhone and a laptop, but do a superior job in their respective field.

Still, having near-instant access to news, weather, email, books, comics, and most websites makes the Nook Simple Touch a great little device, especially if you can find one used.

Oh well, a fool and his money....  Buy this now!

I should have done more research.

On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.

If tapping does not work, you can not reach your ebooks, however there are some phisical buttom on the tool, also.Funny and annoying.Now the situation is : sometimes it does sense the tapping, sometimes doesn't.Final annoying concern: spam mail per almost every day, about how to spend your money on ebooks and related things.Favourites beyond all negatives:Nice , Light, Quick, Handle all kind of characters and signs (not just letters, but mathematical formulas also, and not just English letters, but other ones, also), Size of the letters can adjustable.

Also, if you want to read more about the publication or customer reviews, you must go online to do it - it can not be done from the Nook.

I am happy with this eReader from Nook but I would advise to buy the one with GlowLight so that you can read at any time.

First let me say this nook is lightweight and simple and good for anyone who simply loves to read and wants to bring their library with them.

The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.

Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter "library."

For the money, though, it is a better buy.

I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.

The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)

But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...

But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N;, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)

I got excuses like: they warehouse is busy, and you have to send yours back first (even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back).At this point, I don't even want it anymore.

(2) Even if I didn't, I could still buy books for the Google eBookstore at Google Play using a computer with an internet conection.Other things to consider:- Will you be reading books or daily publications more?

I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques (maybe I should read the instructions) but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.

You should just buy the newer ones.

Even the B&N; Forum has many references to the problem.I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem.

it is my first e-reader  ;) thank you...I recommend the Nook Simple Touch to any one who loves to read as I do.

I may buy a Kindle some time-if I truly find a reason, but it will be a backup to my Nook library.I know that Amazon is doing this loss leader thing, selling at a loss, trying to convert everyone to Kindles so that you will be married to them forever (now that they finally have something that can compete with the Nook simple touch and Nook color).

Also, I've heard that you get free coupons and even occasionally a free book when you enter B&N; -- haven't gotten to try that feature out yet, my campus bookstore isn't officially a real B&N;, but I'm looking forward to it.Wifi: the Nook doesn't generate its own hotspot, but considering that practically everywhere you're going to go is jumping on the wifi bandwagon you shouldn't need one.

the touch screen works better than i thought it would and seems scratch resistnant, i prefer it to the ones with buttons because you dont have to push to turn the page.

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.

This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N; or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.

Various contacts via on-line support chat, telephone support and visits to Barnes and Noble stores have yielded the following:  The people on the other end of the conversation basically have no knowlege of the problem and direct you through a series of needless exercises in hopes that something will work.

SOLUTIONS:  Drive to another location where Wi-Fi works (suggested by one B&N; person).

sometimes the copy just ends in the middle of a page when it's not the end of a paragraph or anything, just to continue at the top of the next page....None of these glitches are acceptable to me....they're all annoying and #2 totally distorts the meaning of the content...I'd give this unit the highest rating if the darn .pdf conversion worked correctly....so, I'm still looking for an eReader that works with pdfs...

The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly.

However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.

Carrying the NOOK in one's pocket can create some issues with the touch screen, and it tends otherwise to cause the device to crash.

If you're on the fence regarding e readers, go with this one and help keep book stores alive!!

You can also connect to a Barnes and Noble WiFi and read the books you want for free up to an hour.The Nook has one drawback, it does not have the Economist magazine available yet.

I would recommended it to anyone looking for an ereader at an affordable price.

I love my Nook Simple Touch and would recommend it to anyone.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.

My cons list is really more of a wishlist, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the NST to anyone, especially at the lowered $99 price.

She loved it and said it was the only one her school would let her use to get school books.

I did have to "help" some of them,  but that was easy too, requiring just a touch on the download prompt.The touch keypad is larger and easier to use than on the 1st Gen, although with "fat fingers" or poor hand control,  a stylus makes a nice aid.Someone in another review forum said that the Simple Touch lacks the ability to highlight and make notes.

So I bought this onerooCASE Executive Leather Portfolio (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Barnes and Noble Nook Simple Touch / Nook Simple Touch with Glow LightIt is absolutely fantastic, and inexpensive but not in any way cheap!!

I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.

But unfortunaly my test kindle file would not work on the nook, not the nooks fault as it reads files from everyone else.Choose the nook for it's simple touch.

This is clearly a bait-n-switch because none of this is mentioned if you buy it in a physical store.The Nook comes with no advertisements and is a wonderful reading experience!

You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N; is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.

If I want to buy something, I do it via my phone's nook app, or the web.-  While my battery life is good *now*, it wasn't so good when I first got it.

Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

Bought a Nook in Bangkok _Sort of happy with it_Then_ just browsing a store where a lady was demo-ing a Kindle_Sooooooo much better_Bought one & haven't looked at a Nook since

Barnes and Noble hit one out of the park with this ereader!

compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!

Save your money.

If you want to be mad and say then "well why did you give it one star???!!!!"

You have to download everything onto your PC and transfer via the cable included.

There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you.

It was just what I wanted, without all of the extra apps and everything else that distracts you from reading.

After that you can buy books with your credit card if everything works perfect which it never does.

You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.

Stylus support (like the Samsung Galaxy Note), handwriting recognition and voice recording should definitely be on the planning board.

It's very handy and comfortable, you can have as much books as you want just inserting a microSD card.

Also the buttons on the side that can be used to turn the page (if you dont wanna touch the screen) on the Nook Simple Touch are great and come in handy!

The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.

)I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision.

You can search through your books for a typed phrase or word (very handy when trying to find a certain passage for writing a paper, or in-class discussions!)

Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!

Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around.

It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month

Easy to hold in hands, however I recommend you to buy a protective case for it to make your reading even easier and more comfortable.

In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.

look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.

My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.)

The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color.

Also, if you want to read more about the publication or customer reviews, you must go online to do it - it can not be done from the Nook.

For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory.

The best buy for external memory is 8 GIG.

For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.

Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.

This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.

I do prefer my Kindle but the Simple Touch Nook is an excellent choice as well.

Once you have books or other materials in your library you can organize them onto "shelves" of your own choice.

Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.

Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from.

Excelent choice on a e-book reader small, light, and clear to read any book!

compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!

What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.

Nook is awesome!The name sucks tough :)The price-quality ratio is great and this ereader, once rooted and running on android, can read just about any file type, no longer limited to epub and PDF (terrible format for ereaders).The delivery came way ahead of schedule, that was a pleasant surprise.So thanks AceElectronix and Barnes&Noble;!

You have to download everything onto your PC and transfer via the cable included.

Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back).

EDIT:  A year later...  the page buttons on the right side stick or don't work most of the time.

You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N; is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.

They are basically quite similar devices.My primary use is going to be reading product manuals and datasheets that are as a matter of unwrittenrule in the PDF format.

They were so inexpensive I got one for me & one for my wife.I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great.

The nook e book reader has been a good buy for my wife.

(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; "Block" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode...

Kindle is a step forward with this "most have" feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness.

There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself.

Various contacts via on-line support chat, telephone support and visits to Barnes and Noble stores have yielded the following:  The people on the other end of the conversation basically have no knowlege of the problem and direct you through a series of needless exercises in hopes that something will work.

However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.

If I want to buy something, I do it via my phone's nook app, or the web.-  While my battery life is good *now*, it wasn't so good when I first got it.

Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

You have to download everything onto your PC and transfer via the cable included.

So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).

Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website.

The online support was very patient in helping me figure out why I couldn't connect and how to download the required software update.

You can buy ebooks from anywhere, download from Project Gutenberg or borrow from the local library and using adobe digital editions manage your library on the Nook.

This device has buggy wireless software so I do not recommend it unless you are willing to always download your books from a USB connection to a wired computer.

Honestly, that USB download process is buggy too.

At first, a downloaded book showed up on the USB Nook-drive icon on the computer, where I drag-and-dropped it into the Library folder, and would NOT show up in the Nook library display.

nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader, weather sony or nook.

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

sony reader for your computer is a epub & pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library ,where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook,through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader - prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereader-prs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz, so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi - fi ,in-case i want to pay $12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wi-fi book, but i dont think so.

You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store.

The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads.

The item is very complicated to use if you want to download public library books.

you need first to get an adobe program then download book to computer etc.

You type in the name of a book into google and add "epub download" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)

There is a multi-step process that requires me to download them onto Adobe, hook up the Nook, and drag each download onto the Nook.3.)

They love that you can download library book.

So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!

While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.

B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.

For PC owners with Internet access, you can still connect to B&N; from your PC, buy your E-product, download it and transfer it to your Simple Touch.

Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.

Wifi Connectivity:What the **** is the point of having wifi if you can only use it for downloading purchases from B&N.

I did have to "help" some of them,  but that was easy too, requiring just a touch on the download prompt.The touch keypad is larger and easier to use than on the 1st Gen, although with "fat fingers" or poor hand control,  a stylus makes a nice aid.Someone in another review forum said that the Simple Touch lacks the ability to highlight and make notes.

Essay to download free books (I suggest Project Gutenberg).

For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory.

Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit.

You need to create a B&N; account to get normal use of it.

It's not usable on the internet for browsing or my amazon books that I can get on my bigger nook with an app.

Looking up a word in the dictionary can be accessed only through the touch screen and it is always responsive, BUT it might be frustrating for someone with big fingers because touching the screen and highlighting the intended word to look up might result with the device highlighting the word above or below it.

4 stars because it's really easy to use, you can find a lot of books the battery lasts for about 2-3 weeks (and i read about 6 hours a day at least).The only disadvantage is that maybe i could use a little bigger screen.But in general it's worth it's money!

So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!

The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!

The two BIG differences is that the ebook store on amazon is WAY better than the ebook store on B&N; (which is a big deal to me) and I like the fact that I can search content on WIFI with the Amazon reader (such as wikipedia).

Even though the nook can be a potentially great e-reader, the reading experience for an e-reader is most important - and that's where this falls extremely short.The biggest obstacle comes to the usage of the dictionary.

Its so simple, but really makes a big difference and that really sums up the Nook.

Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.)

If your not the biggest reader, and you like to play gives, I recommend getting the Nook Tablet or Kindle Fire, NOT THE NOOK COLOR!

You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store.

You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default.

Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.

I do prefer my Kindle but the Simple Touch Nook is an excellent choice as well.

I would highly recommend this item to anyone just wanting an e-reader it's great!!

The item is very complicated to use if you want to download public library books.

)Menu / keyboard items are not scalableNo parental filters / controlsNo on board method to manage files or memory usageThe small screen size decreases reading continuity at larger text sizes; no ability to view text in LandscapeApparently, Amazon really prefers you buy the Kindle, observing they are offering the NOOK for $40 more than for the price it is offered at Barnes and Noble.Summary:I own a Kindle and a NOOK Touch.

The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly.

However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.

Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.

Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles!

Consider to buy an additional memory card to increase the capacity of this device and to buy it from BluProton seller, they have one of the finest and most efficient services worldwide.

From this one user's experience: if you go with Nook, hope that you won't need their customer service.

My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

There is no "period", or "dot", in the numerical keyboard, so it is not possible to enter another url, either to make a purchase from another bookseller, or, more importantly from my point of view, to log on to the local library (this would appear to apply to local US libraries as well; what a waste of WiFi!).

Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.

The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!

)-install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too-Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard-Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N; reader and the rest of the device's functionality.I used these instructions:[Amazon removed my link.

eBoook is realy simple touch reader whith a correct price and very useful on day by day travel to my office.It is exactly the device that I want.

Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).

It is easily charged from a micro USB connection and files can easily be copied from a PC.The crystal clear text and easy touch or button navigation make reading a pleasure.

For some reason buttons make me feel very comfortable, but I do however use the touch screen every once in a while.

Also the buttons on the side that can be used to turn the page (if you dont wanna touch the screen) on the Nook Simple Touch are great and come in handy!

Since there are page-turn buttons, it would be helpful if the Nook had a feature to temporarily disable the touch screen.

(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; "Block" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode...

EDIT:  A year later...  the page buttons on the right side stick or don't work most of the time.

Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.

The buttons require you to either press in just the right place, or press too hard, so there is always a pause to see if it did turn, or if I should hit it again.- The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. B&N; battle since the books I'm buying may not work on the devices of the future, and for the short term, they definitely will not work.

adobe digital editions will recon-nize your nook when you plug in the usb cord and has a drop down menu button that says copy ebook to nook.SIDELOAD means plug usb2 cable that comes with nook into computer and into nook.

The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.

Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter "library."

These buttons require more force, and that's if you press the center of the button.

Good luck if you press either the top or the bottom portion of the button.

Press lightly on the outside rim of the page to turn it either way, press buttons on either side to turn the page the same direction that you have been turning.

the touch screen works better than i thought it would and seems scratch resistnant, i prefer it to the ones with buttons because you dont have to push to turn the page.

My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile "buttons" that will allow you to change pages.

- fashionable design, I particularly like the white rim- the page turn buttons are sturdy(while others complained about the "stickyness" I actually preferred it)- love, love, love the shelves option - I work at a library and enjoy putting things where the

You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N; is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.

I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen.

compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!

I do prefer my Kindle but the Simple Touch Nook is an excellent choice as well.

From what I've read, calling B&N tech support is a waste of time.

Save the time and just buy the book or really lose your mind a go to a used book store and buy any book you want for around a dollar and finally don't even consider calling tech support they are useless.

The online support was very patient in helping me figure out why I couldn't connect and how to download the required software update.

Also, if you want to read more about the publication or customer reviews, you must go online to do it - it can not be done from the Nook.

Learning point: never order something online in the "My Nook - My Library" and expect to actually read it.I also do not like the way that newspapers and magazines are presented.

)I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision.

So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!

They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.

There are a number of online websites that will allow you to upload Word docs and convert to epub for free.

You can only get the ad-free version online (for $140) or shell out $40 AFTER you buy the unit.

(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE.

You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.

This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though.

If you are interested in reading you will not be dissapointed!My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that I wish there were more books available that I could share.

wether you read a lot or a little, it is just simply the best & so many available books....

Recent announcements tell you that Amazon.com has followed through on this and that the first batch of fixes are already available.

Of course another solution would be to 1.Acknowledge the problem, 2.State and estimated date when a resolution may be available.

If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.

You can also connect to a Barnes and Noble WiFi and read the books you want for free up to an hour.The Nook has one drawback, it does not have the Economist magazine available yet.

Wish the screen were a bit brighter & that current books were available for less.

Well, controls are easy to learn, but in case you forget something, the user guide is already inside as your first available book.

Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software.

I do not buy anything that is not fully touch screen if it can be.

For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.

The Barnes and noble store built into the nook simple touch is pretty good, and should suit the full needs of most people.

It fits the Nook very well and is also a beautifull case.I am thinking to buy more of them in combos as presents to my other family members.

I fully recommend this e-book for gift or personal

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf.

Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software.

However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.

sony reader for your computer is a epub & pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library ,where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook,through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader - prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereader-prs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz, so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi - fi ,in-case i want to pay $12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wi-fi book, but i dont think so.

I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.

Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.

One software update and two other fixes later, and it STILL drains the battery by the minute, lasting only about 8 hours, instead of the promised 2 months.

I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month

compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!

Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire.

Instead I use an e-reader for my personal files (textbooks and news articles for example) and am left having to connect the device to my computer every.

Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from.

It is easily charged from a micro USB connection and files can easily be copied from a PC.The crystal clear text and easy touch or button navigation make reading a pleasure.

What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook.

However says that the Nook is the cheapest tablet out thier and the best well you are wrong  .

Looking up a word in the dictionary can be accessed only through the touch screen and it is always responsive, BUT it might be frustrating for someone with big fingers because touching the screen and highlighting the intended word to look up might result with the device highlighting the word above or below it.

But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

Even though the nook can be a potentially great e-reader, the reading experience for an e-reader is most important - and that's where this falls extremely short.The biggest obstacle comes to the usage of the dictionary.

If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.

From this one user's experience: if you go with Nook, hope that you won't need their customer service.

I understand you should do some research on products before you buy them but reading the users guide may be a stretch.

Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing).

For a user who only want's the basics, this is perfect.

I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from.

Well, controls are easy to learn, but in case you forget something, the user guide is already inside as your first available book.

It is easily charged from a micro USB connection and files can easily be copied from a PC.The crystal clear text and easy touch or button navigation make reading a pleasure.

And please, Amazon and B&N;, work hard on making sure that e-books are device agnostic in the future.

On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.

But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!

So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!

)-install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too-Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard-Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N; reader and the rest of the device's functionality.I used these instructions:[Amazon removed my link.

But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N;, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)

It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.A case is a worthwhile consideration.

Easy to use, bright screen and since its capacity can be expanded up to 32 gb by adding a micro sd card I think it is better than a Kindle.

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire.

Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page.

(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; "Block" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode...

The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)

But I would only recommend this product if your library has a good selection of ebooks, or if you don't mind not owning a physical book.

It looks like you are reading a physical book.

They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.

This is clearly a bait-n-switch because none of this is mentioned if you buy it in a physical store.The Nook comes with no advertisements and is a wonderful reading experience!

My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

Kindle is a step forward with this "most have" feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness.

If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.

There is no option to disable the touch screen while reading.I was required to connect the Nook to a B&N; account on setup.

You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it.

- fashionable design, I particularly like the white rim- the page turn buttons are sturdy(while others complained about the "stickyness" I actually preferred it)- love, love, love the shelves option - I work at a library and enjoy putting things where the

Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once.

This device has buggy wireless software so I do not recommend it unless you are willing to always download your books from a USB connection to a wired computer.

If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.

Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.

In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.

However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.

The only way you can add content to your device (other than purchasing content from B&N;) is to hook it up to the computer?

A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble.

I do not hold B&N; accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.

The two BIG differences is that the ebook store on amazon is WAY better than the ebook store on B&N; (which is a big deal to me) and I like the fact that I can search content on WIFI with the Amazon reader (such as wikipedia).

sometimes the copy just ends in the middle of a page when it's not the end of a paragraph or anything, just to continue at the top of the next page....None of these glitches are acceptable to me....they're all annoying and #2 totally distorts the meaning of the content...I'd give this unit the highest rating if the darn .pdf conversion worked correctly....so, I'm still looking for an eReader that works with pdfs...

Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.That's about it.

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.

Need a word definition?

)I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision.

This model doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the others Nooks but, in my opinion, you don't need them.A note about battery life - it's amazing!

It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.A case is a worthwhile consideration.

- fashionable design, I particularly like the white rim- the page turn buttons are sturdy(while others complained about the "stickyness" I actually preferred it)- love, love, love the shelves option - I work at a library and enjoy putting things where the

No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service.

Would be interesting to see a report from someone that knows specifics about the software shop that developed the Nook Simple Touch code.

Two points only:1) The ereader device is wonderful2) DO NOT purchase ebooks from B&N; as they contain additional security restrictions that make it extremely difficult / not possible to compile into Adobe Digital Edition for transfer to other ereader devices.

Rooting the Nook (via Nooter), while not difficult, does require some level of computer know-how.

It's tiny, portable, and even with my case fits perfectly in my purse for my morning commute.

Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.

You can toggle this feature on & off, and there is an Amazon site that lets you view readers' highlighting for ANY book--not just the books you own.

Opera Mobile allows for web browsing; various RSS readers make keeping up with the news a cinch; Mango provides more manga than I can ever hope to read; you can even install Amazon's Kindle app for Android!

The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books.

If you're on the fence regarding e readers, go with this one and help keep book stores alive!!

Nook is awesome!The name sucks tough :)The price-quality ratio is great and this ereader, once rooted and running on android, can read just about any file type, no longer limited to epub and PDF (terrible format for ereaders).The delivery came way ahead of schedule, that was a pleasant surprise.So thanks AceElectronix and Barnes&Noble;!

LIke Amazon, B&N; tries to lock readers in to purchasing from their store, but if you're resistant, it's easy to side-load books using Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre on either device.

I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen.

compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!

Aside from that, highly recommend!

But it's great to take on the go, the batter lasts a long time and you can read with it outside.

I would assume most people buying an e-reader would want to take theirs with them outside of the house.

However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.

The Nook is definitely worth the money, even though it costs considerably more than a book would.

This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though.

Also, you cannot make a purchase with B&N; from outside the US, on this machine.

Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86.

Also the buttons on the side that can be used to turn the page (if you dont wanna touch the screen) on the Nook Simple Touch are great and come in handy!

Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back).

Remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device!

EDIT:  A year later...  the page buttons on the right side stick or don't work most of the time.

But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

The buttons require you to either press in just the right place, or press too hard, so there is always a pause to see if it did turn, or if I should hit it again.- The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. B&N; battle since the books I'm buying may not work on the devices of the future, and for the short term, they definitely will not work.

Consider to buy an additional memory card to increase the capacity of this device and to buy it from BluProton seller, they have one of the finest and most efficient services worldwide.

this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader .

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

the email address for sony reader is inside sony ereader.

sony reader for your computer is a epub & pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library ,where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook,through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader - prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereader-prs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz, so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi - fi ,in-case i want to pay $12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wi-fi book, but i dont think so.

adobe lets you look at/read-- the book on your computer and see if you want to sideload it into your nook.

You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store.

Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources.

Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter "library."

You can turn a page with just a tap of your finger on the screen, or press a side bar.

)I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision.

(2) Even if I didn't, I could still buy books for the Google eBookstore at Google Play using a computer with an internet conection.Other things to consider:- Will you be reading books or daily publications more?

Save the time and just buy the book or really lose your mind a go to a used book store and buy any book you want for around a dollar and finally don't even consider calling tech support they are useless.

You can use this just like a book outside in the sun.

Press lightly on the outside rim of the page to turn it either way, press buttons on either side to turn the page the same direction that you have been turning.

Also, I've heard that you get free coupons and even occasionally a free book when you enter B&N; -- haven't gotten to try that feature out yet, my campus bookstore isn't officially a real B&N;, but I'm looking forward to it.Wifi: the Nook doesn't generate its own hotspot, but considering that practically everywhere you're going to go is jumping on the wifi bandwagon you shouldn't need one.

It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.A case is a worthwhile consideration.

If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.

Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles!

Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.That's about it.

You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N; is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.

LIke Amazon, B&N; tries to lock readers in to purchasing from their store, but if you're resistant, it's easy to side-load books using Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre on either device.

Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit.

It is only for reading.She loves to read and this encourages that wonderful hobby.

This is clearly a bait-n-switch because none of this is mentioned if you buy it in a physical store.The Nook comes with no advertisements and is a wonderful reading experience!

Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit.

While I still pick  up a regular book, my nook is enjoyable, and easy to take along, doesn't rip or get torn up.

But it's great to take on the go, the batter lasts a long time and you can read with it outside.

And personally the nook simple touch just FEELS better as in the navigation is faster and more smooth than the kindle touch which seemed to take longer and be a lot more "Blinky" on the kindle touch.

Rooting can be a long task if your not use to android terminology although if your already familiar with developing on android its a pretty simple process.

after holding out for so long in converting from paper to digital, i decided to take the plunge and buy the nook.

Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.

You can read for as long as you like.

Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility.

You have a nice light, long battery life E-reader that works well in appropriate lighting.

Nook is awesome!The name sucks tough :)The price-quality ratio is great and this ereader, once rooted and running on android, can read just about any file type, no longer limited to epub and PDF (terrible format for ereaders).The delivery came way ahead of schedule, that was a pleasant surprise.So thanks AceElectronix and Barnes&Noble;!

So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck.

Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue.

I would assume most people buying an e-reader would want to take theirs with them outside of the house.
