My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

There is no "period", or "dot", in the numerical keyboard, so it is not possible to enter another url, either to make a purchase from another bookseller, or, more importantly from my point of view, to log on to the local library (this would appear to apply to local US libraries as well; what a waste of WiFi!).

Consider to buy an additional memory card to increase the capacity of this device and to buy it from BluProton seller, they have one of the finest and most efficient services worldwide.

I love it and would suggest it for anyone looking at purchasing an e reader.

$10 cheaper than anyone else.

I would highly recommend this item to anyone just wanting an e-reader it's great!!

Great tool for education, and I highly recommend Nook for anyone.

First let me say this nook is lightweight and simple and good for anyone who simply loves to read and wants to bring their library with them.

I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly.

I would recommended it to anyone looking for an ereader at an affordable price.

I love my Nook Simple Touch and would recommend it to anyone.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.

My cons list is really more of a wishlist, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the NST to anyone, especially at the lowered $99 price.

Only if you only want an ereader and don't want tablet functions to distract you while reading.

Press near the top right corner to "bookmark" the page, press in the middle of the screen to open up a small main menu (from which you can access your homepage, your library, the shop, settings, etc), press and hold over a word to highlight, mark, or look it up.

* Expandable storage slot* Excellent support for open book formats* Touch screen* Even smaller and compact.If you are OK with 6 to 8 hours of battery, go for Nook Color and root it.

They are basically quite similar devices.My primary use is going to be reading product manuals and datasheets that are as a matter of unwrittenrule in the PDF format.

My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf.

Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources.

price: nook - cheaper or same price as kindle with ads.screen: nook (barely) - same screen nook software makes slightly better typeface.non-drm ebook format: nook - supports more popular epub vs kindle support of mobi.other document formats: kindle - supports .doc, .txt, & .rtf; nook doesn't.borrowing from library support: nook - better for now, but popularity of kindles and Amazon marketing may change that, time will tell if libraries start purchasing kindle only ebooks.other paid book sources: nook - can read books purchased from other ebooks stores like google, sony, etc.

You have to call and beg them to lose your information and delete the account.

The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!

Once you have mastered the idiosyncratic technique for converting books to EPUB format and loading them onto the NOOK - I suggest getting a copy of CALIBRE which will streamline the conversion process.

So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books.

Pros:Touch screenExcellent battery lifeSized well for pockets or pursesThe gestures are pretty intuitiveThe functionality of ePub books is very goodThe device is able to use books from other sources who use ePub or PDF format (library or other sourceCons:The on-board memory capacity is 236MB (!

However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.

It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.A case is a worthwhile consideration.

I choose this product because it's capable of support diferent formats, I convert my pdf files in EPUB whit free programs (calibre and sigil) and mi readings are now easy and the graphics are visualized correctly.

However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software.

Nook is awesome!The name sucks tough :)The price-quality ratio is great and this ereader, once rooted and running on android, can read just about any file type, no longer limited to epub and PDF (terrible format for ereaders).The delivery came way ahead of schedule, that was a pleasant surprise.So thanks AceElectronix and Barnes&Noble;!

Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.That's about it.

compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!

adobe digital editions will recon-nize your nook when you plug in the usb cord and has a drop down menu button that says copy ebook to nook.SIDELOAD means plug usb2 cable that comes with nook into computer and into nook.

My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.

If you are looking for an ereader with a great browser, mp3 and mp4 capabilities,than the nook Simple Touch is NOT for you (get the nook Color or Nook Tablet).

The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!

Second, you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi, and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.

Side-loaded material is not up for discussion.There is a lightly functional Web browser embedded in the Search function of the NOOK Touch.

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

You don't have to register, give credit card info or whatever.Your kuddos to Terence Eden's blog.

However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.

The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour.Well, as a gift for my doughter, Nook Touch is perfect, small, light and stylish.

Yet at Band N if you walk in, the same Nook is priced at $79 and you get a $20 gift card if you buy one .

Even the B&N; Forum has many references to the problem.I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem.

The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N; support page fixed that.2.

)Menu / keyboard items are not scalableNo parental filters / controlsNo on board method to manage files or memory usageThe small screen size decreases reading continuity at larger text sizes; no ability to view text in LandscapeApparently, Amazon really prefers you buy the Kindle, observing they are offering the NOOK for $40 more than for the price it is offered at Barnes and Noble.Summary:I own a Kindle and a NOOK Touch.

There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you.

If you want a great ereader with no real flaws, the latest in ereader technology, an extraordinary battery life, and an easy to use interface than this is the ereader to get.I was stuck between the kindle touch and a nook simple touch but I chose the nook because it displays books better (has pictures and the actual book covers instead of just the title in words) and the Touch screen is a lot more responsive on the Nook Simple Touch than on the kindle touch.

At first, a downloaded book showed up on the USB Nook-drive icon on the computer, where I drag-and-dropped it into the Library folder, and would NOT show up in the Nook library display.

But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

What I like about Nook (so far):-easy to use-has a memory card slot for more storage capacity-light and convenient to carry around-very good for a basic readerWhat I don't like:-sometimes the display appears fadedAll in all, I'm liking my new Nook.

Press near the top right corner to "bookmark" the page, press in the middle of the screen to open up a small main menu (from which you can access your homepage, your library, the shop, settings, etc), press and hold over a word to highlight, mark, or look it up.

For me, I'm gonna wait for an Amazon Kindle Touch device with a Pearl e-ink matrix.

I could definitely use a light on my Nook.A Nook is definitely a great product if you're looking for a e-ink reader without the annoying backlight that you get from computers and tablets.

(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; "Block" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode...

If nook make a large screen e-ink e-reader, may be 9 inch or A4.

Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.)

The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads.

You can only get the ad-free version online (for $140) or shell out $40 AFTER you buy the unit.

Additionally I don't have the Glow Light, but if the Glow Light was of better quality, I probably would have purchased that version instead.

Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.

Nook is awesome!The name sucks tough :)The price-quality ratio is great and this ereader, once rooted and running on android, can read just about any file type, no longer limited to epub and PDF (terrible format for ereaders).The delivery came way ahead of schedule, that was a pleasant surprise.So thanks AceElectronix and Barnes&Noble;!

Create a strong and exquisite foundation for a great reading experience and add graphics on top, rather than adding modernity to a product at the cost of the quality of the reading experience.

I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.

nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader, weather sony or nook.

this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader .

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.

My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.

Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.

Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86.

Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.

In unfortunate contrast, Kindle offers a generic Serif, a generic Sans Serif, & something they call "Condensed".Nook's screen is crystal clear & glare resistant; and their lovely fonts provide an elegant reading experience.I must confess to you, I found Nook's Font Superiority Compelling, and when combined with the fact that the device itself sports a superior, more elegant design, I truly wanted Nook to prevail in this contest.

It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month

Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from.

Remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device!

I do not hold B&N; accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.

You need to create a B&N; account to get normal use of it.

You MUST tie a credit card to your B&N; account or you can't buy anything including FREE books!3.

Once you create a B&N; account, it is a pain in the butt to try to delete it.

You have to call and beg them to lose your information and delete the account.

There is no option to disable the touch screen while reading.I was required to connect the Nook to a B&N; account on setup.

You have to plug it into the computer and actually log into the account - then delete it there.

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone.

Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

For cheaper than the original nook.

My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

Plus even if it only works ok, it's so cute it will make up for all the problems.

The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.

EDIT:  A year later...  the page buttons on the right side stick or don't work most of the time.

The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N; support page fixed that.2.

The buttons require you to either press in just the right place, or press too hard, so there is always a pause to see if it did turn, or if I should hit it again.- The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. B&N; battle since the books I'm buying may not work on the devices of the future, and for the short term, they definitely will not work.

And please, Amazon and B&N;, work hard on making sure that e-books are device agnostic in the future.

It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations.

Software works good and even manages to go through my medical review books easily and do keyword searches.

If tapping does not work, you can not reach your ebooks, however there are some phisical buttom on the tool, also.Funny and annoying.Now the situation is : sometimes it does sense the tapping, sometimes doesn't.Final annoying concern: spam mail per almost every day, about how to spend your money on ebooks and related things.Favourites beyond all negatives:Nice , Light, Quick, Handle all kind of characters and signs (not just letters, but mathematical formulas also, and not just English letters, but other ones, also), Size of the letters can adjustable.

Tapping - when works - can take paging very very easy.

The product does not work as advertised, if you ever have a problem Barnes & Noble won't even bother to help and they will make their best for you to lose your patience and leave it as trash at home.

Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.

You type in the name of a book into google and add "epub download" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)

works excellence  for me would recommend the use of this product more buyers.

I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.

After that you can buy books with your credit card if everything works perfect which it never does.

So have to wait to hear back from the company I bought it from for a return and then see if I can get a replacement that works.

the touch screen works better than i thought it would and seems scratch resistnant, i prefer it to the ones with buttons because you dont have to push to turn the page.

I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.

Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around.

B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.

Various contacts via on-line support chat, telephone support and visits to Barnes and Noble stores have yielded the following:  The people on the other end of the conversation basically have no knowlege of the problem and direct you through a series of needless exercises in hopes that something will work.

SOLUTIONS:  Drive to another location where Wi-Fi works (suggested by one B&N; person).

Your less technical friends and relatives or those who do not have a PC and rely on working wFi-Fi may not be so lucky.

You have a nice light, long battery life E-reader that works well in appropriate lighting.

sometimes the copy just ends in the middle of a page when it's not the end of a paragraph or anything, just to continue at the top of the next page....None of these glitches are acceptable to me....they're all annoying and #2 totally distorts the meaning of the content...I'd give this unit the highest rating if the darn .pdf conversion worked correctly....so, I'm still looking for an eReader that works with pdfs...

The nook seems to work great now that I can use it, but using barnes and noble for you ebooks might not be the best idea.

- fashionable design, I particularly like the white rim- the page turn buttons are sturdy(while others complained about the "stickyness" I actually preferred it)- love, love, love the shelves option - I work at a library and enjoy putting things where the

But unfortunaly my test kindle file would not work on the nook, not the nooks fault as it reads files from everyone else.Choose the nook for it's simple touch.

The devise worked for 30 minutes or less and quit.

I excitedly booted up my Nook only to find out that it would not work with a non-US credit card.

You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.

You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.

Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.

Second, you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi, and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.

You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files.

You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it.

look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.

Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.

My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

Ebooks reduce paper consumptions and save trees.

but it will serve the purpose of replacing paperbacks for my son who is in the military.

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

after holding out for so long in converting from paper to digital, i decided to take the plunge and buy the nook.

I do not hold B&N; accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.

Learning point: never order something online in the "My Nook - My Library" and expect to actually read it.I also do not like the way that newspapers and magazines are presented.

*Barnes & Noble actually has stores to go and ask questions*On the nook, you can change the wallpaper/screensaver.

You can search through your books for a typed phrase or word (very handy when trying to find a certain passage for writing a paper, or in-class discussions!)

It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month

If you're looking for an alternative to paper books, this is a great device.

I wish it lit up in the dark so you could continue reading when it was time for lights out, but I just ordered a light for it so that should help.

However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.

Learning point: never order something online in the "My Nook - My Library" and expect to actually read it.I also do not like the way that newspapers and magazines are presented.

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.

I know this borderline heresy on Amazon's website, however, I truly prefer the Nook experience over the Kindle!

The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books.

Carrying the NOOK in one's pocket can create some issues with the touch screen, and it tends otherwise to cause the device to crash.

For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory.

Nook could provide some sort of introductory leaflet describing how to access the e-book's different functions.

Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources.

My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.

This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though.

You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default.

For some reason buttons make me feel very comfortable, but I do however use the touch screen every once in a while.

I may buy a Kindle some time-if I truly find a reason, but it will be a backup to my Nook library.I know that Amazon is doing this loss leader thing, selling at a loss, trying to convert everyone to Kindles so that you will be married to them forever (now that they finally have something that can compete with the Nook simple touch and Nook color).

I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.

They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.

Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software.

If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the "Shop" tab to access B&Ns; website.

But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N;, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)

My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

* Expandable storage slot* Excellent support for open book formats* Touch screen* Even smaller and compact.If you are OK with 6 to 8 hours of battery, go for Nook Color and root it.

The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour.Well, as a gift for my doughter, Nook Touch is perfect, small, light and stylish.

For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.

However I love going to the Barnes & Noble store because if you take your Nook, you are able to read any Nook book for free for up to 1 hour per day without purchasing it.

There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself.

4 stars because it's really easy to use, you can find a lot of books the battery lasts for about 2-3 weeks (and i read about 6 hours a day at least).The only disadvantage is that maybe i could use a little bigger screen.But in general it's worth it's money!

This piece of junk takes hours to set up and you really need a laptop also.

One software update and two other fixes later, and it STILL drains the battery by the minute, lasting only about 8 hours, instead of the promised 2 months.

I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.

You can also connect to a Barnes and Noble WiFi and read the books you want for free up to an hour.The Nook has one drawback, it does not have the Economist magazine available yet.

Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles!

A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble.

(Not 1, because e-reader can use other friends/partners and read different books)- Remember each book stop reading page, if I restart book again.- Need slide toolbar for quick select directory, shelf  etc.

However ummm the price here on amazon is a bit high its cheaper on bn website or at bestbuy.

Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.

Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.

If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the "Shop" tab to access B&Ns; website.

Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website.

if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect.

Opera Mobile allows for web browsing; various RSS readers make keeping up with the news a cinch; Mango provides more manga than I can ever hope to read; you can even install Amazon's Kindle app for Android!

Still, having near-instant access to news, weather, email, books, comics, and most websites makes the Nook Simple Touch a great little device, especially if you can find one used.

Second, you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi, and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.

It's best to buy this device directly from Barnes & Noble, either the store or the website.

Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.

There are a number of online websites that will allow you to upload Word docs and convert to epub for free.

This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.

I know this borderline heresy on Amazon's website, however, I truly prefer the Nook experience over the Kindle!

If I want to buy something, I do it via my phone's nook app, or the web.-  While my battery life is good *now*, it wasn't so good when I first got it.

The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color.

For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.

Also, if you want to read more about the publication or customer reviews, you must go online to do it - it can not be done from the Nook.

As other reviews have noted - Amazon's price is higher than if you buy it at the B&N; store.

* Expandable storage slot* Excellent support for open book formats* Touch screen* Even smaller and compact.If you are OK with 6 to 8 hours of battery, go for Nook Color and root it.

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf.

I choose this product because it's capable of support diferent formats, I convert my pdf files in EPUB whit free programs (calibre and sigil) and mi readings are now easy and the graphics are visualized correctly.

However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software.

I could BUY a program to convert the files or I could pay Amazon "a small fee" to convert them for me.I took my Kindle BACK to Best Buy and spoke to another Sales guy that was very helpful and explained to me that the Nook will EASILY read my pdf books.

Sometimes while reading a book I will accidently touch the screen and the menu will pop up or the page will turn.

adobe digital editions will recon-nize your nook when you plug in the usb cord and has a drop down menu button that says copy ebook to nook.SIDELOAD means plug usb2 cable that comes with nook into computer and into nook.

For example, the Nook has a home-page and a very simple menu to orient yourself between different screens.

Press near the top right corner to "bookmark" the page, press in the middle of the screen to open up a small main menu (from which you can access your homepage, your library, the shop, settings, etc), press and hold over a word to highlight, mark, or look it up.

The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly.

If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.

(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; "Block" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode...

If you're on the fence regarding e readers, go with this one and help keep book stores alive!!

I've used both the Nook and Kindle readers and purchased the Nook ST for my personal use because I prefer to have buttons as well as the touch screen.

It's so much easier to look up the meaning of a word, you can have a wish list for books you want to buy, which you can't do on the old one.

There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you.

At first, a downloaded book showed up on the USB Nook-drive icon on the computer, where I drag-and-dropped it into the Library folder, and would NOT show up in the Nook library display.

When you buy a Nook, you cannot assume to use it unless someone has told you ahead of time that the purchase, unlike any other electronic device, does not include a charger.

If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying &#34;this nook cannot read this file.

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

You must delete every thing all at once and start from empty all over again.A very bad feature nook should change as soon as possible.The saving grace is the large 500 book capacity of the nook and the slot to install a 32 gb flash drive memory stick so that nook can hold 1000 books.

I hope you have a better experience with your NOOK- if, that is, you decide to buy this older model.

after holding out for so long in converting from paper to digital, i decided to take the plunge and buy the nook.

I do not hold B&N; accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.

Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.

Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.

Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book.

This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.

I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.

If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.

You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap.

Easy to hold in hands, however I recommend you to buy a protective case for it to make your reading even easier and more comfortable.

Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources.

I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques (maybe I should read the instructions) but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.

The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.

It is easily charged from a micro USB connection and files can easily be copied from a PC.The crystal clear text and easy touch or button navigation make reading a pleasure.

However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.

Didn't realize you need a credit card on file to be able to load books onto the Nook.

You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files.

Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website.

If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying &#34;this nook cannot read this file.

Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.

You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store.

Pdf files are NOT viewable on your Kindle and the conversion process is complicated.

I could BUY a program to convert the files or I could pay Amazon "a small fee" to convert them for me.I took my Kindle BACK to Best Buy and spoke to another Sales guy that was very helpful and explained to me that the Nook will EASILY read my pdf books.

You can upload a few different file types and read them easily.

They needed too many personal data, before using the tool.It is also funny in case of an ebook reader.The PDF files that I copied to Nook  were not readable.

I even could not reach my files, because tapping needs for 'opening' the tools.

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books.

)Menu / keyboard items are not scalableNo parental filters / controlsNo on board method to manage files or memory usageThe small screen size decreases reading continuity at larger text sizes; no ability to view text in LandscapeApparently, Amazon really prefers you buy the Kindle, observing they are offering the NOOK for $40 more than for the price it is offered at Barnes and Noble.Summary:I own a Kindle and a NOOK Touch.

I choose this product because it's capable of support diferent formats, I convert my pdf files in EPUB whit free programs (calibre and sigil) and mi readings are now easy and the graphics are visualized correctly.

The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.

Nook is awesome!The name sucks tough :)The price-quality ratio is great and this ereader, once rooted and running on android, can read just about any file type, no longer limited to epub and PDF (terrible format for ereaders).The delivery came way ahead of schedule, that was a pleasant surprise.So thanks AceElectronix and Barnes&Noble;!

You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it.

Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.

Instead I use an e-reader for my personal files (textbooks and news articles for example) and am left having to connect the device to my computer every.

But unfortunaly my test kindle file would not work on the nook, not the nooks fault as it reads files from everyone else.Choose the nook for it's simple touch.

You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.

Didn't realize you need a credit card on file to be able to load books onto the Nook.

Remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device!

You MUST tie a credit card to your B&N; account or you can't buy anything including FREE books!3.

After that you can buy books with your credit card if everything works perfect which it never does.

If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.

Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.

The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.

Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.

While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.

You don't have to register, give credit card info or whatever.Your kuddos to Terence Eden's blog.

I paid for the Nook with my non-US credit card.

I excitedly booted up my Nook only to find out that it would not work with a non-US credit card.

The online support was very patient in helping me figure out why I couldn't connect and how to download the required software update.

The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N; support page fixed that.2.

I keep looking for a new firmware update to finally solve this issue, but I doubt B&N; will have any forthcoming.Update: I think the problem I described above is a flaw with my own device and not about firmware.

One software update and two other fixes later, and it STILL drains the battery by the minute, lasting only about 8 hours, instead of the promised 2 months.

This is an update from my initial review.This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal.

This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.

I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.

You can upload a few different file types and read them easily.

When you buy a Nook, you cannot assume to use it unless someone has told you ahead of time that the purchase, unlike any other electronic device, does not include a charger.

this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader .

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

I have only charged this device 4 times since owning it.If you are interested in "apps", or music, or surfing... this product is not for you.

You stop using it and you must charge it .

I heartily recommend the Nook Touch.Battery: Depending on usage levels you don't have to charge it too often, I read on mine in breaks between classes and when I have an assignment for an English class and only have to charge it every couple of weeks.

If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.

This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.

It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month

Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.

But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!

I keep looking for a new firmware update to finally solve this issue, but I doubt B&N; will have any forthcoming.Update: I think the problem I described above is a flaw with my own device and not about firmware.

This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N; or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.

However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.

For example, the Nook has a home-page and a very simple menu to orient yourself between different screens.

It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month

It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations.

A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble.

The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books.

I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

The buttons require you to either press in just the right place, or press too hard, so there is always a pause to see if it did turn, or if I should hit it again.- The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. B&N; battle since the books I'm buying may not work on the devices of the future, and for the short term, they definitely will not work.

But unfortunaly my test kindle file would not work on the nook, not the nooks fault as it reads files from everyone else.Choose the nook for it's simple touch.

However ummm the price here on amazon is a bit high its cheaper on bn website or at bestbuy.

From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.

My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile "buttons" that will allow you to change pages.

If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.

Wish the screen were a bit brighter & that current books were available for less.

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

You must delete every thing all at once and start from empty all over again.A very bad feature nook should change as soon as possible.The saving grace is the large 500 book capacity of the nook and the slot to install a 32 gb flash drive memory stick so that nook can hold 1000 books.

Additionally I don't have the Glow Light, but if the Glow Light was of better quality, I probably would have purchased that version instead.

Pdf files are NOT viewable on your Kindle and the conversion process is complicated.

Then they suggested updating my software version to avoid problems in the future.

Once you have mastered the idiosyncratic technique for converting books to EPUB format and loading them onto the NOOK - I suggest getting a copy of CALIBRE which will streamline the conversion process.

sometimes the copy just ends in the middle of a page when it's not the end of a paragraph or anything, just to continue at the top of the next page....None of these glitches are acceptable to me....they're all annoying and #2 totally distorts the meaning of the content...I'd give this unit the highest rating if the darn .pdf conversion worked correctly....so, I'm still looking for an eReader that works with pdfs...

I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

You can only get the ad-free version online (for $140) or shell out $40 AFTER you buy the unit.

There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you.

You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default.

For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.

Thank you soooo much for your kindness and my grandson loves the Nook.I recommend them highly and I dont give recommendations so easily.

If you want a great ereader with no real flaws, the latest in ereader technology, an extraordinary battery life, and an easy to use interface than this is the ereader to get.I was stuck between the kindle touch and a nook simple touch but I chose the nook because it displays books better (has pictures and the actual book covers instead of just the title in words) and the Touch screen is a lot more responsive on the Nook Simple Touch than on the kindle touch.

And personally the nook simple touch just FEELS better as in the navigation is faster and more smooth than the kindle touch which seemed to take longer and be a lot more "Blinky" on the kindle touch.

(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; "Block" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode...

Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.

the filthy rich would like the wi fi 12.99 book ,though.I thought that the nook touch screen would be cool , but it is kind of a pain the the butt because the nook changes pages when ever your finger gets even close to the screen, weather you want to change pages or not.

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire.

Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources.

price: nook - cheaper or same price as kindle with ads.screen: nook (barely) - same screen nook software makes slightly better typeface.non-drm ebook format: nook - supports more popular epub vs kindle support of mobi.other document formats: kindle - supports .doc, .txt, & .rtf; nook doesn't.borrowing from library support: nook - better for now, but popularity of kindles and Amazon marketing may change that, time will tell if libraries start purchasing kindle only ebooks.other paid book sources: nook - can read books purchased from other ebooks stores like google, sony, etc.

x-ray is pretty cool.connectivity: kindle - for an additional $50 you can get a kindle with 3G.page turns: nook - slightly faster.

If tapping does not work, you can not reach your ebooks, however there are some phisical buttom on the tool, also.Funny and annoying.Now the situation is : sometimes it does sense the tapping, sometimes doesn't.Final annoying concern: spam mail per almost every day, about how to spend your money on ebooks and related things.Favourites beyond all negatives:Nice , Light, Quick, Handle all kind of characters and signs (not just letters, but mathematical formulas also, and not just English letters, but other ones, also), Size of the letters can adjustable.

Most of the guys here have Kindles and they love them, I would recommend and wish I did, get a kindle.

*You can do that ^ on the kindle but you have to hack it first.Although I do think that the Kindle IS a better device, it a lot more expensive if you want no ads.

Can't go wrong w/ this ereader - much better, lighter, faster than the kindle, just watch the price if purchasing on amazon.

The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)

But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N;, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)

On kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on Kindel store.

What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.

But unfortunaly my test kindle file would not work on the nook, not the nooks fault as it reads files from everyone else.Choose the nook for it's simple touch.

I guess I can't speak for the kindle, but using our Nook to borrow from libraries has been a total waste of time.

Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

Who ever said that the kindle has a better library is telling lies B&N has an equal or better ebook and "app" library.

The screen itslef barely blinks even without any kind of special protection (of course if you don't try to put it right under the lightbulb).

If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.

look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.

Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.

My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

I could definitely use a light on my Nook.A Nook is definitely a great product if you're looking for a e-ink reader without the annoying backlight that you get from computers and tablets.

Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR).

Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back).

So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).

but it will serve the purpose of replacing paperbacks for my son who is in the military.

Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.

this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader .

TEXTBOOK USER beware though that charts and tables are at a fixed size and cannot be enlarged.Overall very happy and most of all I love not looking at a backlit screen for enjoyment.

The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.

)-install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too-Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard-Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N; reader and the rest of the device's functionality.I used these instructions:[Amazon removed my link.

The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)

I got excuses like: they warehouse is busy, and you have to send yours back first (even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back).At this point, I don't even want it anymore.

I may buy a Kindle some time-if I truly find a reason, but it will be a backup to my Nook library.I know that Amazon is doing this loss leader thing, selling at a loss, trying to convert everyone to Kindles so that you will be married to them forever (now that they finally have something that can compete with the Nook simple touch and Nook color).

So have to wait to hear back from the company I bought it from for a return and then see if I can get a replacement that works.

You can also connect to a Barnes and Noble WiFi and read the books you want for free up to an hour.The Nook has one drawback, it does not have the Economist magazine available yet.

Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.)

Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit.

If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.

compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!
