This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire.
I love it and would suggest it for anyone looking at purchasing an e reader.
I love this product, and I recommend it to EVERYONE.
I love my Nook simple touch but will review another time.
Thank you soooo much for your kindness and my grandson loves the Nook.I recommend them highly and I dont give recommendations so easily.
In unfortunate contrast, Kindle offers a generic Serif, a generic Sans Serif, & something they call "Condensed".Nook's screen is crystal clear & glare resistant; and their lovely fonts provide an elegant reading experience.I must confess to you, I found Nook's Font Superiority Compelling, and when combined with the fact that the device itself sports a superior, more elegant design, I truly wanted Nook to prevail in this contest.
However I love going to the Barnes & Noble store because if you take your Nook, you are able to read any Nook book for free for up to 1 hour per day without purchasing it.
TEXTBOOK USER beware though that charts and tables are at a fixed size and cannot be enlarged.Overall very happy and most of all I love not looking at a backlit screen for enjoyment.
So that is really the only problem I have with this.Other than that, if you just want something simple --like the products suggest - you will love this little device.
Most of the guys here have Kindles and they love them, I would recommend and wish I did, get a kindle.
First let me say this nook is lightweight and simple and good for anyone who simply loves to read and wants to bring their library with them.
If you're looking for something simple without bells and whistles and are a true book lover, you will love this nook.
So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!
They love that you can download library book.
it is my first e-reader  ;) thank you...I recommend the Nook Simple Touch to any one who loves to read as I do.
So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!
It is only for reading.She loves to read and this encourages that wonderful hobby.
I love my Nook Simple Touch and would recommend it to anyone.
- fashionable design, I particularly like the white rim- the page turn buttons are sturdy(while others complained about the "stickyness" I actually preferred it)- love, love, love the shelves option - I work at a library and enjoy putting things where the
She loved it and said it was the only one her school would let her use to get school books.
If you love your partner and yourself - upgrade it for your own benefit.
It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations.
You have a nice light, long battery life E-reader that works well in appropriate lighting.
Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.
I have only charged this device 4 times since owning it.If you are interested in "apps", or music, or surfing... this product is not for you.
It was just what I wanted, without all of the extra apps and everything else that distracts you from reading.
However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires.
The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color.
compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!
In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.
look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.
You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.
There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself.

nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader, weather sony or nook.
Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.
the email address for sony reader is inside sony ereader.
sony reader for your computer is a epub & pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library ,where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook,through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader - prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereader-prs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz, so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi - fi ,in-case i want to pay $12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wi-fi book, but i dont think so.
price: nook - cheaper or same price as kindle with ads.screen: nook (barely) - same screen nook software makes slightly better typeface.non-drm ebook format: nook - supports more popular epub vs kindle support of mobi.other document formats: kindle - supports .doc, .txt, & .rtf; nook doesn't.borrowing from library support: nook - better for now, but popularity of kindles and Amazon marketing may change that, time will tell if libraries start purchasing kindle only ebooks.other paid book sources: nook - can read books purchased from other ebooks stores like google, sony, etc.
There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself.
If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying &#34;this nook cannot read this file.
Once you create a B&N; account, it is a pain in the butt to try to delete it.
So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!
From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.
You type in the name of a book into google and add "epub download" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)
Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing).
I may buy a Kindle some time-if I truly find a reason, but it will be a backup to my Nook library.I know that Amazon is doing this loss leader thing, selling at a loss, trying to convert everyone to Kindles so that you will be married to them forever (now that they finally have something that can compete with the Nook simple touch and Nook color).
You can search through your books for a typed phrase or word (very handy when trying to find a certain passage for writing a paper, or in-class discussions!)
Also, I've heard that you get free coupons and even occasionally a free book when you enter B&N; -- haven't gotten to try that feature out yet, my campus bookstore isn't officially a real B&N;, but I'm looking forward to it.Wifi: the Nook doesn't generate its own hotspot, but considering that practically everywhere you're going to go is jumping on the wifi bandwagon you shouldn't need one.
They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.
This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.
The screen itslef barely blinks even without any kind of special protection (of course if you don't try to put it right under the lightbulb).
My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.
Stylus support (like the Samsung Galaxy Note), handwriting recognition and voice recording should definitely be on the planning board.
It's very handy and comfortable, you can have as much books as you want just inserting a microSD card.
Also the buttons on the side that can be used to turn the page (if you dont wanna touch the screen) on the Nook Simple Touch are great and come in handy!
The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.
)I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision.
You can search through your books for a typed phrase or word (very handy when trying to find a certain passage for writing a paper, or in-class discussions!)
Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!
Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around.
It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month
I did have to "help" some of them,  but that was easy too, requiring just a touch on the download prompt.The touch keypad is larger and easier to use than on the 1st Gen, although with "fat fingers" or poor hand control,  a stylus makes a nice aid.Someone in another review forum said that the Simple Touch lacks the ability to highlight and make notes.
Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

Easy to hold in hands, however I recommend you to buy a protective case for it to make your reading even easier and more comfortable.
This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though.
I hope you have a better experience with your NOOK- if, that is, you decide to buy this older model.
Touch screen is very good and grat reading aunctions, higher than espectations, would have enjoyed however more extra functionalities on this model, such as listening to music.
The "newest model" is the Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight, and not this model.
This model doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the others Nooks but, in my opinion, you don't need them.A note about battery life - it's amazing!
I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.
The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color.
My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure, there are minus points for Nook too:- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me.- No option for 3G.
Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.
If you are looking for an ereader with a great browser, mp3 and mp4 capabilities,than the nook Simple Touch is NOT for you (get the nook Color or Nook Tablet).
The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!
Second, you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi, and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.
Side-loaded material is not up for discussion.There is a lightly functional Web browser embedded in the Search function of the NOOK Touch.
If tapping does not work, you can not reach your ebooks, however there are some phisical buttom on the tool, also.Funny and annoying.Now the situation is : sometimes it does sense the tapping, sometimes doesn't.Final annoying concern: spam mail per almost every day, about how to spend your money on ebooks and related things.Favourites beyond all negatives:Nice , Light, Quick, Handle all kind of characters and signs (not just letters, but mathematical formulas also, and not just English letters, but other ones, also), Size of the letters can adjustable.
On kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on Kindel store.
Buying at the store also gives you the opportunity to purchase the extended warranty, which protects your NOOK from drops and liquid spills, etc, for two years.
Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books.
Buying at the store also gives you the opportunity to purchase the extended warranty, which protects your NOOK from drops and liquid spills, etc, for two years.
The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.
The Barnes and noble store built into the nook simple touch is pretty good, and should suit the full needs of most people.
nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader, weather sony or nook.
I even could not reach my files, because tapping needs for 'opening' the tools.
Second, you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi, and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.
Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles!
I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.
I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.
You can review books, buy or get samples of books, and share books with your friends.

Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.
Your less technical friends and relatives or those who do not have a PC and rely on working wFi-Fi may not be so lucky.
Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.First the Nook feels better.
Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from.
No hassle, you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries, and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends, pass it on to your kids, sell it at a garage sale, etc.
It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!
(Not 1, because e-reader can use other friends/partners and read different books)- Remember each book stop reading page, if I restart book again.- Need slide toolbar for quick select directory, shelf  etc.
I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.
I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.
POINT: NOOK.Generally, if you are shopping for an inexpensive, simple e-reader, I strongly urge you to buy the Nook, and not the Kindle.
Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best.
Barnes & Noble also frequently runs NOOK promotions in the store - just recently there was a coupon for a free box of Godiva Chocolates for NOOK owners.Just sayin'.
If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.
look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.
Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.
My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.
I could definitely use a light on my Nook.A Nook is definitely a great product if you're looking for a e-ink reader without the annoying backlight that you get from computers and tablets.
Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR).
Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back).
So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).
but it will serve the purpose of replacing paperbacks for my son who is in the military.
Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 1-2 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.
this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader .
TEXTBOOK USER beware though that charts and tables are at a fixed size and cannot be enlarged.Overall very happy and most of all I love not looking at a backlit screen for enjoyment.
The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.
)-install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too-Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard-Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N; reader and the rest of the device's functionality.I used these instructions:[Amazon removed my link.
The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)
I got excuses like: they warehouse is busy, and you have to send yours back first (even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back).At this point, I don't even want it anymore.
I may buy a Kindle some time-if I truly find a reason, but it will be a backup to my Nook library.I know that Amazon is doing this loss leader thing, selling at a loss, trying to convert everyone to Kindles so that you will be married to them forever (now that they finally have something that can compete with the Nook simple touch and Nook color).
So have to wait to hear back from the company I bought it from for a return and then see if I can get a replacement that works.
You can also connect to a Barnes and Noble WiFi and read the books you want for free up to an hour.The Nook has one drawback, it does not have the Economist magazine available yet.
Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.)
Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit.
If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.

although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another.
look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.
Would recommend it for home or away&#34;
The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N; support page fixed that.2.
The product does not work as advertised, if you ever have a problem Barnes & Noble won't even bother to help and they will make their best for you to lose your patience and leave it as trash at home.
For example, the Nook has a home-page and a very simple menu to orient yourself between different screens.
Press near the top right corner to "bookmark" the page, press in the middle of the screen to open up a small main menu (from which you can access your homepage, your library, the shop, settings, etc), press and hold over a word to highlight, mark, or look it up.
The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.
This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N; or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.
Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.
For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.
Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.
This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.
I do prefer my Kindle but the Simple Touch Nook is an excellent choice as well.
Once you have books or other materials in your library you can organize them onto "shelves" of your own choice.
Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.
Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from.
Excelent choice on a e-book reader small, light, and clear to read any book!

It's tiny, portable, and even with my case fits perfectly in my purse for my morning commute.
The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour.Well, as a gift for my doughter, Nook Touch is perfect, small, light and stylish.
It's the perfect ebook reader and plus you can install Android OS to see mail (a good help sometimes).
if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect.
Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).
The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!
After that you can buy books with your credit card if everything works perfect which it never does.
For a user who only want's the basics, this is perfect.
I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.
compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!
It's the perfect ebook reader and plus you can install Android OS to see mail (a good help sometimes).
If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the "Shop" tab to access B&Ns; website.
Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that.
The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.
You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N; is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.
However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.
The only way you can add content to your device (other than purchasing content from B&N;) is to hook it up to the computer?
A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble.
I do not hold B&N; accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.
The two BIG differences is that the ebook store on amazon is WAY better than the ebook store on B&N; (which is a big deal to me) and I like the fact that I can search content on WIFI with the Amazon reader (such as wikipedia).
sometimes the copy just ends in the middle of a page when it's not the end of a paragraph or anything, just to continue at the top of the next page....None of these glitches are acceptable to me....they're all annoying and #2 totally distorts the meaning of the content...I'd give this unit the highest rating if the darn .pdf conversion worked correctly....so, I'm still looking for an eReader that works with pdfs...
Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.That's about it.
No hassle, you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries, and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends, pass it on to your kids, sell it at a garage sale, etc.
Would be interesting to see a report from someone that knows specifics about the software shop that developed the Nook Simple Touch code.
Recommendation to B&N, get different software development team with experience writing bulletproof production code for 2.0.
However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device.
The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf.
Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software.
This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.
Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website.
The online support was very patient in helping me figure out why I couldn't connect and how to download the required software update.
This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software.
What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook.
The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N; support page fixed that.2.
This device has buggy wireless software so I do not recommend it unless you are willing to always download your books from a USB connection to a wired computer.
Using the Adobe Digital software to unlock library books with the nook was a headache at first, and I'm a librarian who is somewhat tech-savy.
price: nook - cheaper or same price as kindle with ads.screen: nook (barely) - same screen nook software makes slightly better typeface.non-drm ebook format: nook - supports more popular epub vs kindle support of mobi.other document formats: kindle - supports .doc, .txt, & .rtf; nook doesn't.borrowing from library support: nook - better for now, but popularity of kindles and Amazon marketing may change that, time will tell if libraries start purchasing kindle only ebooks.other paid book sources: nook - can read books purchased from other ebooks stores like google, sony, etc.
Then they suggested updating my software version to avoid problems in the future.
(like I am installing a new software !!!
One software update and two other fixes later, and it STILL drains the battery by the minute, lasting only about 8 hours, instead of the promised 2 months.
The Simple Touch "found" Wi-Fi at McDonalds but could not complete the connection using McDonald's "proxy" software where you had to comply before you could continue.
Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles!
However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software.
For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory.
One gig for software to run the Nook and 3/4 for books purchased from Barnes.
You type in the name of a book into google and add "epub download" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)
You can review books, buy or get samples of books, and share books with your friends.
nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader, weather sony or nook.
Buying a cover and quality book light completes the package giving you the feel of a real book without the weight and the ability to read in bed at night ;) You can shop over a wifi network directly from your nook, while in Barnes and Noble read any nook book for free as long as you are there and connected to their wifi network, and you can even add your favorite social networks to share things with your friends.
Your less technical friends and relatives or those who do not have a PC and rely on working wFi-Fi may not be so lucky.
Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.First the Nook feels better.
No hassle, you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries, and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends, pass it on to your kids, sell it at a garage sale, etc.
(Not 1, because e-reader can use other friends/partners and read different books)- Remember each book stop reading page, if I restart book again.- Need slide toolbar for quick select directory, shelf  etc.
If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.
With the Nook, you're buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the e-reader space.Two word recommendation: Research selection (before purchase)I hope I've helped.
A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble.
If you decide to "manually" load books via USB, realize you have only 250mb of space for this purpose!
But after getting my nook I realized all the space I've been saving by not having a bookshelf.
4 stars because it's really easy to use, you can find a lot of books the battery lasts for about 2-3 weeks (and i read about 6 hours a day at least).The only disadvantage is that maybe i could use a little bigger screen.But in general it's worth it's money!
It's tiny, portable, and even with my case fits perfectly in my purse for my morning commute.
Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader.
Easy.Also, for those technically savvy and geeky, it can be rooted to a very basic Android tablet with limited functionality (email, light browsing).
the email address for sony reader is inside sony ereader.
Still, having near-instant access to news, weather, email, books, comics, and most websites makes the Nook Simple Touch a great little device, especially if you can find one used.
Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.
If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you.
The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color.
But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!
I keep looking for a new firmware update to finally solve this issue, but I doubt B&N; will have any forthcoming.Update: I think the problem I described above is a flaw with my own device and not about firmware.
This E-reader is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other reviewers, but if you own one and upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware (automatically by B&N; or manually) you may have lost your ability to connect via Wi-Fi in some Wi-Fi environments including in your own home.
However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.
