Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.
So that is really the only problem I have with this.Other than that, if you just want something simple --like the products suggest - you will love this little device.
If you're looking for something simple without bells and whistles and are a true book lover, you will love this nook.
