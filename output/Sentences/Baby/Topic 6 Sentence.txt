You never smell anything from these!

I can't say enough great things about it.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

It's a pretty easy problem to fix!

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

Sturdy construction, easy operation.

It's a pretty easy problem to fix!

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

This is a great baby shower gift!

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

The genie because a problem with refills and odors.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

It contains the odor with no problem.

My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

I have had no problems with it whatsoever--it is very easy to use.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama.

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

We don't have a problem with the nursery smelling at all!!

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

It's a pretty easy problem to fix!

But absolutely never an odor problem.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.

I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

It's also easy to wipe down.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

I have a two month old.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

The old one...

It also holds a lot of diapers.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.

It holds more diapers too.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

Hold your breath!!!

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!

Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

This product does not work for the following reasons:1.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

We compared this too the other one and decided we liked the idea of the common garbage bag better.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.

Those go right in the garbage outside!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?

It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

But it's just the nature of garbage.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

Now you're taking out an extra bag of garbage every day or two!!

A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

I have recommended this to all new parents!

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

But our new one is completely worthless!

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

As a first time parent I highly recommend this!

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

It takes regular trash bags.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

You can use regular bags instead of special ones.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.

If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

at least once a week)  there is no odor!!!

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

I wash it every few weeks.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.

I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper "dissapears".

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

So we ended up just throwing it away!

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

You'll save a lot of money by using this one.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Sure it saves money.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

Overall, we were satisfied with the product and feel it is worth the money.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.

You put your diaper in flip the handle and thats it.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

It works great and cleans up very easily.

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

Plus, there is no odor, even when it is full!

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

We change the bag about every 5 days when its full, which every 5 days is not bad at all!

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

Hopefully just an error that will be corrected.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

It claims to keep the smell of dirty diapers in.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

As a first time parent I highly recommend this!

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

This is a great baby shower gift!

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

I highly recommend it because it's a great value.

And the price is great also!

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

The bottom is wider than the top so the diapers fill up the wider spot at the bottom making it hard to pull the bag out of the top.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

Very easy just to flip the top with one hand.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!

I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.

It worked great for the 1st 5 months.

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.
