I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.
It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).
The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.
Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.
I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.
