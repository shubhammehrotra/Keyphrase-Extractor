I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.
It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).
The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.
Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.
I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.
I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.
The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.
It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.
You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.
Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.
I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.
I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.
But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.
It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.
There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).
Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.
I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.
No need to stick your hand inside.
Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?
Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.
When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.
If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.
You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.
Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!
My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.
Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
We only have one tiny complaint.
The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.
It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.
And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.
Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.
I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.
It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.
It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.
I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.
So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.
It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.
it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.
If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.
The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!
My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.
I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.
I would get this if I had kids.
To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.
If you're still picky put in an airfreshner.
When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.
At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...
It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!
Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.
BRILLIANT idea...didn't have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.
i swear its air-tight.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.
We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!
SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.
I highly recommend it because it's a great value.
For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.
For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.
This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.
The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.
We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.
I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.
When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.
It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!
Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!
I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.
Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.
It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.
Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.
What a great diaper pail!
It works great and cleans up very easily.
It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.
This is a great product.
Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.
They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.
It worked great for the 1st 5 months.
My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.
If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.
It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.
But overall, its been great.
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
And the price is great also!
It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
It so easy and so great I love it!!
I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.
This is great!
This model is great!
Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.
It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!
I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!
Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great.
My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!
Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in.
This is a great baby shower gift!
This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.
I can't say enough great things about it.
I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.
We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.
The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.
Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.
!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!
This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.
It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.
Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.
Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.
It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.
So far, I've been very pleased with this item.
Please do not make the same mistake as I.
It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.
Please be more conscientious!
Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!
It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.
I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!
The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!
I am very pleased with it.
A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.
Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.
Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.
Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.
I recommend this to all my friends and family.
I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.
It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.
And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.
(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.
Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.
You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.
One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.
Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
Bottom line: diapers smell in anything you put them in.
Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.
I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.
Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.
And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.
I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.
It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.
The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.
We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.
My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.
I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!
I highly recommend thisproduct.
This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
I highly recommend this product.
I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.
I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.
I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.
Excellent buy and highly recommended!
it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it.
I highly recommend it!
I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.
I highly recommend it because it's a great value.
I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.
I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.
I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I definetly would recommend this pail to all.
Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.
I highly recommend it to anyone!
I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.
I highly recommend this product.
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!
I would recommend it.
Highly  recommend.
We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.
I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!
Highly recommended.
I do recommend wiping it off every so often to keep it fresh.
The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!
I highly recommend it.
I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!
I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!
As a first time parent I highly recommend this!
Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!
I would not recommend buying that one.
I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.
I would highly recommend this to anyone!
I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!
HIGHLY recommended!
You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.
I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.
I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.
I have recommended this to all new parents!
:-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!
I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.
I highly recommend this product!
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
I highly recommend that.
I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.
I highly recommend this.
Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.
My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.
Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.
Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -
This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.
I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!
I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.
I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.
It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.
Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.
I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.
Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.
The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.
Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.
The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!
As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.
After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.
As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.
I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.
......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star.....
Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.
Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!
This is a great baby shower gift!
When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!
We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.
You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.
I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.
Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.
Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
Just push down on the lever rather than trying to pull up.
The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.
The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
We only have one tiny complaint.
no complaints from me on this diaper pail.
The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.
I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!
It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!
Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!
I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.
So far, I've been very pleased with this item.
Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!
I am very pleased with it.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?
since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
I have had no trouble with odors so far.
Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.
The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.
The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).
Boy am I glad!
I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.
I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.
The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.
Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.
When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.
I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.
We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.
When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.
I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.
Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.
So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.
The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.
Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!
Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.
The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.
SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)
If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.
****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.
We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.
if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.
My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.
We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.
if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.
I wash it every few weeks.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.
The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.
1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.
Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.
they fit it perfectly.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.
It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.
I don't believe anything is that perfect.
I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!
If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.
Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.
As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.
I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.
It is a waste of 20 bucks.
It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.
Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!
(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.
I highly reccomend this product to all moms!!
It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.
Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.
However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.
My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.
It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.
It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.
She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!
It should probably cost half what it does.
No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!
If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.
It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.
It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.
It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!
My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.
I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.
The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!
As a first time parent I highly recommend this!
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
I have recommended this to all new parents!
It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.
Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.
Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.
That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.
I don't believe anything is that perfect.
****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.
A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!
It was well worth the investment!!!
One ofthe best investments and inventions.
When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!
I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).
Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.
Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.
We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.
one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).
Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.
Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
Just drop in and turn.
It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.
To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.
Just drop in and turn.
We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.
I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.
It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.
The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.
Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.
It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.
Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.
You almost want to change the bag outside!
Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.
I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.
Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.
I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.
Those go right in the garbage outside!
I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.
SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.
It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.
Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.
My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.
For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.
And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.
A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!
Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.
If you have a sensitive nose I guarantee you will smell this pail.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...
You'll save a lot of money by using this one.
We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.
I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.
Sure it saves money.
The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.
Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.
I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!
It is a waste of 20 bucks.
My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
You put your diaper in flip the handle and thats it.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.
Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.
This product does not work for the following reasons:1.
However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.
My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.
I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!
Would definitely reccomend this pail over any other!
I highly recommend thisproduct.
This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
I highly reccomend this product to all moms!!
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
I highly recommend this product.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.
I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.
I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.
Excellent buy and highly recommended!
it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it.
(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!
I highly recommend it!
I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.
I highly recommend it because it's a great value.
The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.
I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.
I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.
I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.
I recommend this to all my friends and family.
I highly recommend this product!
I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!
I definetly would recommend this pail to all.
Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.
I highly recommend it to anyone!
I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.
For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.
I highly recommend this product.
I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!
I would recommend it.
Highly  recommend.
Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!
Highly recommended.
I do recommend wiping it off every so often to keep it fresh.
The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!
I highly recommend it.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!
I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!
As a first time parent I highly recommend this!
Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
I would not recommend buying that one.
I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.
I would highly recommend this to anyone!
I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!
HIGHLY recommended!
You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.
I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.
I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).
Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.
The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!
I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.
I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.
Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!
I have recommended this to all new parents!
We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.
:-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!
I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.
I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.
I highly recommend this product!
Plus it's user friendly.
But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.
Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.
I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
I highly recommend that.
I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.
Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.
I highly recommend this.
When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.
I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.
Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.
In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.
Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.
However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.
My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.
So we ended up just throwing it away!
I have advised all of my friends of this product.
That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).
My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
Mine usually chip when I caught them on the catch!
We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).
All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.
(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)
Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!
That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.
It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.
The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
Sturdy construction, easy operation.
We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.
BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.
Let's face it - diapers stink.
