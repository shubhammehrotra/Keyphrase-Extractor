He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.
If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.
You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.
It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!
It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.
We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.
Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)
It also holds a lot of diapers.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.
It holds more diapers too.
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?
It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!
I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.
Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.
I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.
It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.
Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.
Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.
My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.
I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.
I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.
and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.
I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.
The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.
It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.
So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.
maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.
For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.
I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.
The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.
It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.
Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.
When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.
I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.
We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.
It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.
it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.
We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).
Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.
My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.
For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!
Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.
(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.
My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.
My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.
I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.
Please do not make the same mistake as I.
In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!
We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
This product does not work for the following reasons:1.
I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.
Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.
The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.
But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).
It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.
I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.
You can use regular bags instead of special ones.
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!
You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.
Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.
When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...
Hold your breath!!!
I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.
Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).
It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).
NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!
What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.
Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!
I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.
I put it together when I was on bedrest!
And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.
Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.
When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.
:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.
It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).
****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!
I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).
Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.
We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.
Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.
Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.
I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.
It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.
We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!
I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!
The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.
The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.
The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.
Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)
maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.
When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??
We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.
We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.
Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.
I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.
):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.
If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.
Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.
SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.
Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.
Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?
This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!
Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.
That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.
Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.
When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.
It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.
Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.
*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.
And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.
We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).
Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.
And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.
To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!
It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.
Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.
It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!
The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.
Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.
If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.
You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.
Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.
We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.
As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.
The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.
It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?
The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.
The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.
It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.
I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.
Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].
We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.
We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.
Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.
But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.
The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.
Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.
Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.
This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!
Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.
Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -
Tie it up fast and you're good to go.
Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.
My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.
And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.
I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.
The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!
It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.
The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.
I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.
I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.
The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.
That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.
As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].
Those go right in the garbage outside!
I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.
We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.
We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!
I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.
It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.
We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.
And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.
It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.
I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.
They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.
You can easily take them with you when you go out of the house!
I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.
That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.
The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.
And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.
Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.
But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.
It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.
We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!
The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.
It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.
Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.
The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!
I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.
Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.
But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.
When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.
I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.
We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.
Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.
I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.
If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
You almost want to change the bag outside!
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.
My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.
My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.
Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.
It does contain most of the odors but not all.

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).
Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.
I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.
And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.
It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.
It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.
Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.
Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.
When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.
During this stressful time; why add additional stress.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.
Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.
i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.
I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.
My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!
You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.
It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.
It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.
I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.
It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!
After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.
I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.
Those go right in the garbage outside!
We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!
The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
Please do not make the same mistake as I.
In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!
The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.
Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.
And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!
At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.
Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.
(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.
This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.
I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.
It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.
You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.
It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.
*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.
NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.
When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
Hey, if it stinks, YOU NEED TO TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH MORE OFTEN !!
It stinks to high heaven!!!
We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)
Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.
Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).
I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.
Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!
Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.
I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.
It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.
But regardless, I would suggest that this over any other diaper pail.
But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.
Those go right in the garbage outside!
Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.
No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?
Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.
I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.
Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)
I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.
It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.
The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.
I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.
Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.
Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.
Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -
Tie it up fast and you're good to go.
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.
Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.
It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.
My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.
I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.
That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.
It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!
I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.
It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.
But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.
It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.
It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.
Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.
And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.
I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.
Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.
The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.
I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.
So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.
It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.
When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.
I'd say look for something else!
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.
If you look at the picture you might understand.
I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.
This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.
Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).
We both just like the style and look of the champ.
Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
But diapers with pee only do not smell at all.
So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.
(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).
(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.
It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.
Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you.
That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.
For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.
For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.
Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.
It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.
It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.
I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.
Please do not make the same mistake as I.
Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.
I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.
I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.
I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.
It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.
In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!
It takes regular trash bags.
I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.
A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).
You can easily take them with you when you go out of the house!
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.
If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.
Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.
I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).
But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.
(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).
Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.
If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.
Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.
I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.
I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.
My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.
I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!
And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.
I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.
I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.
When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
We love it's simple design.
Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.
We have yet to smell a thing!Whoever figured out this design is a genius.
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.
There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).
I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.
However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)
Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).
I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.
The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).
Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!
That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.
Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.
Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.
My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.
I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.
I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.
We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.
Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!
Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.
So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.
(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.
And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.
It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.
And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.
This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.
Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.
My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.
The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.
The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.
It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.
What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!
I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!
First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.
Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.
If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.
since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.
one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.
You can use any trash bag2.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.
Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.
He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!
There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.
One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.
Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.
That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.
I highly recommend it because it's a great value.
The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.
The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.
Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.
For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.
With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.
If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.
With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.
This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.
And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!
It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).
Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.
When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.
Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.
I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!
Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.
It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.
We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.
If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.
The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!
We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.
All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.
Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.
You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.
My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.
I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.
It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.
I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.
When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.
since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.
you can use any ol' bag with this.
It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.
I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.
A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.
My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).
This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.
The genie because a problem with refills and odors.
I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.
The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.
Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.
That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.
As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.
I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.
Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.
Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.
It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).
The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.
Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!
We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.
I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.
The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it.
No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)
Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!
As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.
I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.
They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.
You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.
It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.
You can be the judge.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.
I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.
I can't say enough about this product.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.
I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.
AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!
The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.
Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.
The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.
Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?
My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.
First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.
It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.
Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.
I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.
You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.
The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.
There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.
We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.
I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.
To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.
You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.
My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.
I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.
it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.
Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.
It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!
This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.
It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.
We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.
Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.
I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.
It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.
I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.
The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.
When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.
Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.
I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.
We change the bag quite frequently because it is after all a diaper pail.
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.
Fantastic capacity!
It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.
I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.
You can easily take them with you when you go out of the house!
BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!
Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.
It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.
I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
You can use regular bags instead of special ones.
The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.
I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.
You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.
(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).
My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.
I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.
By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.
The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.
If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.
I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.
It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.
i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.
I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.
I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.
......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star.....
I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.
I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.
I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
Mine usually chip when I caught them on the catch!
I can't say enough great things about it.
I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.
Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).
As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.
We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
During this stressful time; why add additional stress.
I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.
I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.
We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.
After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.
I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!
I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.
So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.
(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.
That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!
It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.
It makes chaging a diaper so much easier.
We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.
A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.
If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.
However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.
If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.
SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.
When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!
I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!
Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.
I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.
As a first time parent I highly recommend this!
But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!
My time is precious!
Simply simple and brilliant!
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.
At this time, I am very satisfied with the Diaper Champ.
It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you.
Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.
The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
We love it's simple design.
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.
It's simple to use and is cost efficient.
This is very easy to use and is simple to change.
The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.
I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.
I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.
It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)
Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.
Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.
maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.
The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!
We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.
Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.
He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.
We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.
Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.
It is simpler to use than others that I have tried, and it is odor-free.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.
when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!
I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!
There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.
For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.
During this stressful time; why add additional stress.
Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.
I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.
I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!
I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.
I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.
Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$.
This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.
I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.
I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.
The diaper champ is simple to use and no smells.
When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.
Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.
Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.
We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.
Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.
Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.
It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.
It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.
In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.
It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.
And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.
When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.
Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.
I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!
The unit is very simple to use.
You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.
Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.
Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.
When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.
My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.
Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.
I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.
It claims to keep the smell of dirty diapers in.
I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.
I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!
I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?
BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.
The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.
it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it.
It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)
In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.
I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.
It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.
The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.
I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.
I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.
We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.
Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.
Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.
I recommend this to all my friends and family.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!
This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.
:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.
Tie it up fast and you're good to go.
If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.
And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!
Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.
****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).
You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.
While they do lock, they aren't convenient.
I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!
And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??
It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.
We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.
You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.
We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.
It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.
The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.
At this time, I am very satisfied with the Diaper Champ.
since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.
It's very convenient to use as well.
With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.
My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).
Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.
The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
The genie because a problem with refills and odors.
Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!
Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!
It's simple to use and is cost efficient.
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!
We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.
But I've never tried it before.
Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.
I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.
Please be more conscientious!
The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!
Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!
It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)
This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.
It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.
I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.
We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.
I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out.
There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.
I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.
I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).
The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.
We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!
It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.
I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!
Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.
We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.
After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.
After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.
I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.
At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie.
As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.
I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.
Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.
My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.
After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.
The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.
It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.
It is simpler to use than others that I have tried, and it is odor-free.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.
First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.
She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!
when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!
I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.
I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.
I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.
You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.
For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.
Plus it's user friendly.
But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.
A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).
I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.
This is much easier to use.
You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.
I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.
just to come here and write a review for this.
I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.
I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.
It's not that much easier to use than the Genie either.
Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.
I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.
However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.
I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!
It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.
After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.
It makes chaging a diaper so much easier.
And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.
We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!
I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.
I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.
Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.
I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!
The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.
Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.
Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.
We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.
I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.
They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.
I could not be happier with the Champ!
Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.
1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.
(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.
We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.
When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.
(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.
My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.
I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.
Anybody need two Diaper Genies?
As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.
The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.
i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.
I don't believe anything is that perfect.
Overall, we were satisfied with the product and feel it is worth the money.
It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.
I have advised all of my friends of this product.
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.
(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.
I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.
Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.
While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment.
With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.
one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.
SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
We only have one tiny complaint.
no complaints from me on this diaper pail.
The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.
I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!
While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.
When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.
It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.
The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!
Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.
Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!
The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.
It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.
Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.
:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.
I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!
I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.
It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.
Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.
I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.
Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.
The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.
Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.
As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.
We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.
After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.
As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.
I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.
Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.
