He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

It also holds a lot of diapers.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.

It holds more diapers too.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!

Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

Please do not make the same mistake as I.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

This product does not work for the following reasons:1.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

You can use regular bags instead of special ones.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...

Hold your breath!!!

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

I put it together when I was on bedrest!

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

Tie it up fast and you're good to go.

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].

Those go right in the garbage outside!

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

You can easily take them with you when you go out of the house!

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.

When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

You almost want to change the bag outside!

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

It does contain most of the odors but not all.

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

During this stressful time; why add additional stress.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

Those go right in the garbage outside!

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

Please do not make the same mistake as I.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

Hey, if it stinks, YOU NEED TO TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH MORE OFTEN !!

It stinks to high heaven!!!

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).
