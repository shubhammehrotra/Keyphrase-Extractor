As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

Sure it saves money.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

This is a great baby shower gift!

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

And I just changed the bag yesterday!

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

No need to stick your hand inside.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.

The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.

Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.

Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

I recommend this to all my friends and family.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

I have advised all of my friends of this product.

Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.

All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

Very easy just to flip the top with one hand.

I love that it's one handed and not hard to use at all.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

(3) Only one hand is required to use.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

I highly recommend it to anyone!

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!

I would highly recommend this to anyone!

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

:-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!

I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

Hey, if it stinks, YOU NEED TO TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH MORE OFTEN !!

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

It stinks to high heaven!!!

Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

Let's face it - diapers stink.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.

There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

I can't say enough great things about it.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.

I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.

Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

I recommend this to all my friends and family.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.

Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.

Plus it's user friendly.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

I have advised all of my friends of this product.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

I have had no problems with it whatsoever--it is very easy to use.

All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

There is nothing sealing the smells in.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

I wash it every few weeks.

I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

I definetly would recommend this pail to all.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

I would get this if I had kids.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

All this defeats the purpose of having a "hands-free" diaper pail!

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

The unit is very simple to use.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

I don't believe anything is that perfect.

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.

!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.

You put your diaper in flip the handle and thats it.

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Very easy just to flip the top with one hand.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.

This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.

it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it.

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

Sturdy construction, easy operation.

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

No odor and it is very easy to use and change.

This is very easy to use and is simple to change.

This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.

It is easy to use and I never smell any odor coming from it.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

It is very easy to use.

The diaper champ is very easy to use.

It isn't all that easy to clean either.

On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.

This is easy, but horribly smelly.

It is very easy to use.

Its easy to use and easy to empty.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

There is never a smell and is so easy to empty.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

The Champ is so easy to use and empty.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

It so easy and so great I love it!!

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

Very easy just to flip the top with one hand.

The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

It keeps the smell at bay pretty well and is very easy to use.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

I have had no problems with it whatsoever--it is very easy to use.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

They are so easy to use.

This pail does not smell and it's so easy to use.

Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.

It is very easy to drop the diaper in.

It's a pretty easy problem to fix!

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.

I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.

Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.

It's also easy to wipe down.

Its easy to clean and maintain.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

I plan on ditching it and getting something else asap.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.
