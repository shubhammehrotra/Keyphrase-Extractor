*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

If you have a sensitive nose I guarantee you will smell this pail.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

Hey, if it stinks, YOU NEED TO TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH MORE OFTEN !!

It stinks to high heaven!!!

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

So far, I've been very pleased with this item.

I am very pleased with it.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

Bottom line: diapers smell in anything you put them in.

Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

No need to stick your hand inside.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

I don't need that.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

Anybody need two Diaper Genies?

While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

We only have one tiny complaint.

no complaints from me on this diaper pail.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

I can't say enough about this product.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is?

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

I can't say enough great things about it.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

It was well worth the investment!!!

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.

I'd say look for something else!

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)

If you look at the picture you might understand.

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

We both just like the style and look of the champ.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

Go, Diaper Champ, Go!!

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!

I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!

The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.

When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.

At this time, I am very satisfied with the Diaper Champ.

All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

The diaper champ is very easy to use.

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.

Another draw back for me with the Champ.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.

So, the Diaper Champ.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The Champ is so easy to use and empty.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.

We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!

We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

The diaper champ is simple to use and no smells.

You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!

I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

I could not be happier with the Champ!

Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

We both just like the style and look of the champ.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

And it's inexpensive!

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

While they do lock, they aren't convenient.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.

I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

I am very ver disappointed with the product.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

In my opinion this is the best diaper pail out there.

It was the worst purchase I made.

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.

All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

It works great and cleans up very easily.

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay.

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

I am very ver disappointed with the product.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

I was wrong on the last point.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point.

While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment.

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

Those go right in the garbage outside!

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

I was wrong on the last point.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.

I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.

So far, I've been very pleased with this item.

Please do not make the same mistake as I.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Please be more conscientious!

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

I am very pleased with it.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.

Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

It should probably cost half what it does.

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

I recommend this to all my friends and family.

It's really gross.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

Just push down on the lever rather than trying to pull up.

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.

As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star.....

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

It keeps the smell at bay pretty well and is very easy to use.

It's a pretty easy problem to fix!

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

I love this item!

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

I love it.

We love it's simple design.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

Love it, love it, love it!

I love this diaper pail.

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

We both love it!

It so easy and so great I love it!!

I love this diaper pail so much!!

I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

I love that it's one handed and not hard to use at all.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

I love this diaper pail.

I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

Fantastic capacity!

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

I will use it with infant diapers only.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

Just drop in and turn.

Just drop in and turn.

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

It is very easy to drop the diaper in.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

During this stressful time; why add additional stress.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!

You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

This model is great!

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

I highly reccomend this product to all moms!!

You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!

Sturdy construction, easy operation.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!

I highly recommend thisproduct.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

I highly reccomend this product to all moms!!

I highly recommend this product.

I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.

Excellent buy and highly recommended!

it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it.

I highly recommend it!

I highly recommend it because it's a great value.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I highly recommend this product!

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.

I highly recommend it to anyone!

I highly recommend this product.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

I highly recommend it.

I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!

As a first time parent I highly recommend this!

I would highly recommend this to anyone!

It stinks to high heaven!!!

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

I highly recommend this product!

I highly recommend that.

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.

I highly recommend this.

I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

If you have a sensitive nose I guarantee you will smell this pail.

Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!

I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

All this defeats the purpose of having a "hands-free" diaper pail!

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

It is simpler to use than others that I have tried, and it is odor-free.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

Excellent buy and highly recommended!

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

I would not recommend buying that one.

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

No refills to every buy.

Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

Especially no special bags to buy.

Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.

It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

It's really gross.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.

If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!

It is a waste of 20 bucks.

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

I have used it for 3 days so far and am just thrilled with it.

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

At this time, I am very satisfied with the Diaper Champ.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

Overall, we were satisfied with the product and feel it is worth the money.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

Please do not make the same mistake as I.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

It keeps the smell at bay pretty well and is very easy to use.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.
