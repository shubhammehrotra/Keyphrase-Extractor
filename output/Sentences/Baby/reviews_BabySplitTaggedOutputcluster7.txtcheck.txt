I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.
In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.
Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.
We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.
No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?
In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.
I would not recommend buying that one.
It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.
Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.
In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!
Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.
You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.
I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.
Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.
It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.
Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).
I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.
I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.
This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.
If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.
The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!
Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.
I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.
A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.
The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.
I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...
So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.
It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.
I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.
When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.
I'd say look for something else!
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.
After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.
Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.
The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.
Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.
I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)
If you look at the picture you might understand.
I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.
This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.
Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.
I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.
The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).
We both just like the style and look of the champ.
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).
We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.
Sturdy construction, easy operation.
Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!
It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.
When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.
It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!
My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.
The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.
That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?
BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.
Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.
If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item.
Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.
I plan on ditching it and getting something else asap.
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.
And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!
If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.
Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.
Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.
I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!
We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.
I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.
We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.
since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.
Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.
The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.
We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).
A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.
A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.
Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.
My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.
It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).
But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.
It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)
It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.
The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it.
As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.
maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.
Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.
It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.
As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.
But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.
I would get this if I had kids.
My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.
Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.
The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.
We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.
Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!
I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again!
I put it together when I was on bedrest!
You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.
Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.
When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.
So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.
However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.
You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.
Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.
After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.
The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.
Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.
I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.
Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.
I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.
I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!
The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.
The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.
Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!
It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
It was well worth the investment!!!
So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.
This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.
So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...
don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.
I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!
Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.
After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.
I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.
It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.
It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!
I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.
It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.
Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.
It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.
But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).
I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.
It works great and cleans up very easily.
Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)
Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.
We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.
It worked great for the 1st 5 months.
Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.
It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!
This product does not work for the following reasons:1.
We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.
Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?
It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay.
The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.
It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.
It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.
My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.
I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!
If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.
I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.
The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.
If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.
All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.
They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.
I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.
(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.
Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.
All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.
The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.
1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!
With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.
I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.
I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.
I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.
I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.
I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.
Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.
just to come here and write a review for this.
I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.
(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.
No need to stick your hand inside.
If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.
Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.
It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)
If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.
If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.
It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.
You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.
You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.
I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.
You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.
We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.
It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.
If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.
The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.
It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.
When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.
Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!
No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!
I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.
I don't need that.
We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.
Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.
(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.
We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.
Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.
Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.
And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.
We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!
The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.
It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.
I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.
What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?
That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.
Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.
When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.
(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.
Anybody need two Diaper Genies?
While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.
It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.
For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.
It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.
Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.
Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.
A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.
I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.
This is a great baby shower gift!
When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!
The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.
However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.
I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!
I highly reccomend this product to all moms!!
I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!
No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)
There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.
When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.
no complaints from me on this diaper pail.
I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!
A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!
Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.
I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.
At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!
There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.
I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!
It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.
I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.
We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.
As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.
No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!
I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.
!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.
The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.
It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!
It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!
We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.
I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!
In my opinion this is the best diaper pail out there.
Those go right in the garbage outside!
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!
The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.
My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!
I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.
It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.
It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.
It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!
It works great and cleans up very easily.
I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!
The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.
It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.
:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.
You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.
You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.
You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.
The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!
I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.
No special bags to purchase, no odors, not too bulky.
You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.
I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!
You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.
It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!
You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.
It was the worst purchase I made.
We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.
I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!
I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.
I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.
We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!
It should probably cost half what it does.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
I am very ver disappointed with the product.
I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.
We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.
I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.
When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.
I was wrong on the last point.
At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point.
While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment.
Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!
With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.
I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).
Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.
We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.
I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!
and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.
First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.
I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.
Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!
What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?
The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.
I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.
Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.
Excellent buy and highly recommended!
In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.
I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.
Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.
So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...
And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!
I would not recommend buying that one.
It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.
I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.
What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.
I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!
It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.
It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.
You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.
No refills to every buy.
Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.
A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.
The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.
It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.
My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!
After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.
In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!
I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.
Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.
No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.
Especially no special bags to buy.
Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.
It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item.
We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.
You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.
I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.
I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.
The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!
I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.
You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.
I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.
I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.
I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.
It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.
And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??
Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!
Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.
Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.
I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.
one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.
No need to stick your hand inside.
Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.
It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.
The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.
Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.
You almost want to change the bag outside!
And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??
Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.
They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.
I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.
Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.
since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.
All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.
The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.
Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.
Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!
Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!
I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.
Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!
Those go right in the garbage outside!
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.
I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.
It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.
The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.
Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.
And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.
Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!
It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.
I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!
Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.
I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.
I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.
Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.
Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.
My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.
This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.
It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.
You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.
Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.
When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.
I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.
I still use it, and just put up with the smell.
I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.
It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.
If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.
My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!
Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.
If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.
I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].
I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.
I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.
After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.
I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.
My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.
When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.
The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.
This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.
I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...
I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.
I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!
It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.
It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!
They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.
It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.
I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.
