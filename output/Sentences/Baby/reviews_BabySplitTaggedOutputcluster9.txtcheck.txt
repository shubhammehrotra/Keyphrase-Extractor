You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.
Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.
Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.
my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).
I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.
The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.
A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.
We compared this too the other one and decided we liked the idea of the common garbage bag better.
I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.
It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.
But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.
It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.
Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.
To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!
It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!
We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.
I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.
I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.
I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!
I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.
Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.
Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!
No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!
!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.
If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.
Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!
We don't have a problem with the nursery smelling at all!!
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.
The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.
I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.
As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.
!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.
I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.
They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.
You never smell anything from these!
when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!
I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.
If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)
We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.
We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.
He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!
I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!
Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!
Like I said, we were very happy with it for a few months.
I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!
So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.
We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.
I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.
I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).
Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!
I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.
I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.
We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.
After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.
It worked great for the 1st 5 months.
As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.
My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.
After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.
I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!
We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.
Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.
I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.
I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.
It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!
When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.
You almost want to change the bag outside!
BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.
The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.
This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.
:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.
****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.
You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.
You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.
It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.
The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.
I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.
The genie because a problem with refills and odors.
The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!
It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.
I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).
At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie.
I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.
Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.
We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.
It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.
And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.
I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.
As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.
i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.
It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.
With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.
I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!
The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.
If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!
We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.
I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
But absolutely never an odor problem.
we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.
We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.
I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).
It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.
I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.
You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.
Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.
It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.
I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.
The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.
And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.
Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.
If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.
Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!
This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.
And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.
I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!
:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.
:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.
I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!
****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.
*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?
We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.
Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.
My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.
since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.
With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.
I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.
It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.
Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.
Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.
Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).
If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.
The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!
Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.
As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.
Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.
In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!
I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.
As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.
I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.
My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.
Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?
Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.
I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!
I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.
I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)
I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.
Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.
I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.
It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.
I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.
Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.
So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.
I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!
(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.
What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?
Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.
As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.
The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.
Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great.
If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.
Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.
It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.
It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.
Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.
This is a great baby shower gift!
Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.
I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...
Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.
I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.
Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.
However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.
If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.
SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)
Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.
I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.
I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!
As a first time parent I highly recommend this!
But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!
My time is precious!
You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.
Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.
At this time, I am very satisfied with the Diaper Champ.
It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.
I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.
It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)
Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.
maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.
We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.
We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.
Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.
Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.
He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.
We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!
I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.
For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.
During this stressful time; why add additional stress.
I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.
I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!
I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.
Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$.
This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.
Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.
Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.
We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.
It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.
In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.
When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.
Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.
I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!
You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.
Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.
Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.
When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.
I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!
At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.
We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.
But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.
Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.
I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!
It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.
You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.
I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.
The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.
It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!
They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.
I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.
I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.
My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.
Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.
If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.
Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.
As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.
As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.
one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.
You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.
The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.
Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.
Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.
For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.
So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).
If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.
My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.
I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.
This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!
I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.
the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.
I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.
You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.
Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)
We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!
I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.
I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.
Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.
I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?
Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.
I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.
By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.
It claims to keep the smell of dirty diapers in.
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.
BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.
Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!
Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!
This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!
Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.
It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)
Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.
You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.
Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me
don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.
I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.
We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
I plan on ditching it and getting something else asap.
So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?
great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...
It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.
I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!
You never smell anything from these!
My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.
I'd say look for something else!
I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.
It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.
My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.
Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.
Bottom line: diapers smell in anything you put them in.
I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.
The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!
I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.
This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.
It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.
There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper "dissapears".
Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!
Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.
The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.
No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.
Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.
I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.
when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!
I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.
There is nothing sealing the smells in.
The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.
Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.
I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!
Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.
I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
Like previous posters said, you do have to clean the thing!
It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.
I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.
Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!
I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.
Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.
Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.
Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.
We have yet to smell a thing!Whoever figured out this design is a genius.
Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.
It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.
I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.
I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.
It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.
They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.
BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!
So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.
We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.
Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.
As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.
If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.
I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.
I don't believe anything is that perfect.
We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.
Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.
I can't say enough great things about it.
Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.
So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.
I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.
After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.
Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -
Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.
