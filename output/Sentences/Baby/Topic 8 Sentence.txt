and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.

But overall, its been great.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

Hey, it's worth it!

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.

But our new one is completely worthless!

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$.

It was well worth the investment!!!

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

Overall, we were satisfied with the product and feel it is worth the money.

It should probably cost half what it does.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.

We only have one tiny complaint.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

This is a great baby shower gift!

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

But regardless, I would suggest that this over any other diaper pail.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.

And a lot less expensive, too.

Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

But our new one is completely worthless!

It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.

It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

It is a waste of 20 bucks.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

they fit it perfectly.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

I don't believe anything is that perfect.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.

Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.

We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

I have had no trouble with odors so far.

I don't believe anything is that perfect.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

You almost want to change the bag outside!

The only foul aroma you will smell is when you change the trash bag.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.

And I just changed the bag yesterday!

No odor and it is very easy to use and change.

This is very easy to use and is simple to change.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.

I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.

This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.

You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.

I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.

It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

And about having to change the bag often, once again we are talking about DIRTY DIAPERS!!!

The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

We change the bag quite frequently because it is after all a diaper pail.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

We change the bag about every 5 days when its full, which every 5 days is not bad at all!

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

as a result we change her in the laundry room.

It's a cinch to change the bags.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

It's really gross.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

(I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism).

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.

This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.

It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

I was wrong on the last point.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.

You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

No special bags to purchase, no odors, not too bulky.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.

It was the worst purchase I made.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!

It's simple to use and is cost efficient.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

It's also easy to wipe down.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

You almost want to change the bag outside!

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

Those go right in the garbage outside!

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!

......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star.....

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

There is nothing sealing the smells in.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.

If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

It isn't all that easy to clean either.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.

You put your diaper in flip the handle and thats it.

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Very easy just to flip the top with one hand.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.

This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

Also, a little Lysol spray doesn't hurt either.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray.

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.

The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

i swear its air-tight.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

no complaints from me on this diaper pail.

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

Its easy to use and easy to empty.

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

There is never a smell and is so easy to empty.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

The Champ is so easy to use and empty.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.

I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

just to come here and write a review for this.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

No need to stick your hand inside.

Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

No smelly odors!

It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

This is easy, but horribly smelly.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.

It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.

It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.
