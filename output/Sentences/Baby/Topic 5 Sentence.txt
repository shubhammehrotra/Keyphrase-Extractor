Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

It also holds a lot of diapers.

My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

But our new one is completely worthless!

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

It keeps the smell OUT completely!

(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!

So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

Please do not make the same mistake as I.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.

It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item.

The only foul aroma you will smell is when you change the trash bag.

Like previous posters said, you do have to clean the thing!

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.

When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

And I just changed the bag yesterday!

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

We only have one tiny complaint.

no complaints from me on this diaper pail.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.

All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

One ofthe best investments and inventions.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

It fits about 15-20 diapers.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

I do recommend wiping it off every so often to keep it fresh.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

Just push down on the lever rather than trying to pull up.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

You never smell anything from these!

We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

No refills to every buy.

I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.

Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

It is easy to use and I never smell any odor coming from it.

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.

But I've never tried it before.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!

Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.

It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

There is never a smell and is so easy to empty.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

We have yet to smell a thing!Whoever figured out this design is a genius.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

I have had no problems with it whatsoever--it is very easy to use.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.

Now you're taking out an extra bag of garbage every day or two!!

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

We change the bag about every 5 days when its full, which every 5 days is not bad at all!

But absolutely never an odor problem.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

I wash it every few weeks.

As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.

It fits about 15-20 diapers.

they fit it perfectly.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

But our new one is completely worthless!

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

But absolutely never an odor problem.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.

I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

Hopefully just an error that will be corrected.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

Sure it saves money.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

If you're still picky put in an airfreshner.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

as a result we change her in the laundry room.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

I have used it for 3 days so far and am just thrilled with it.

We'll keep it and use it, but we're hardly thrilled.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

If you have a sensitive nose I guarantee you will smell this pail.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

It's a cinch to change the bags.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.

I plan on ditching it and getting something else asap.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

I'd say look for something else!

It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.

But regardless, I would suggest that this over any other diaper pail.

I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

I definetly would recommend this pail to all.

Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.

I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.

I would recommend it.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.

I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I would not recommend buying that one.

I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.

I would highly recommend this to anyone!

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

I would get this if I had kids.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

Excellent buy and highly recommended!

I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.

Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

Highly recommended.

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

HIGHLY recommended!

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I have recommended this to all new parents!

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

There is nothing sealing the smells in.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

If you have a sensitive nose I guarantee you will smell this pail.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

And it's inexpensive!

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

And a lot less expensive, too.

If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

I could not be happier with the Champ!

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

I do recommend wiping it off every so often to keep it fresh.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

And about having to change the bag often, once again we are talking about DIRTY DIAPERS!!!

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

The bottom is wider than the top so the diapers fill up the wider spot at the bottom making it hard to pull the bag out of the top.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

No refills to every buy.

The genie because a problem with refills and odors.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

And about having to change the bag often, once again we are talking about DIRTY DIAPERS!!!

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.

I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

No refills to every buy.

The genie because a problem with refills and odors.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.

When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

:)  But while it is closed, the odors are contained.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

* What's not to like -- you use you're own bags.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

We compared this too the other one and decided we liked the idea of the common garbage bag better.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.

We both just like the style and look of the champ.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

It makes chaging a diaper so much easier.

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.

It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

This is one heck of a product.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

This is a great baby shower gift!

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

You almost want to change the bag outside!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper "dissapears".

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

It is a waste of 20 bucks.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

It does what I want it to do!

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

It was well worth the investment!!!

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is?

First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I put it together when I was on bedrest!

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

It was the worst purchase I made.

I was wrong on the last point.

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.

I wash it every few weeks.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

So we ended up just throwing it away!

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

BRILLIANT idea...didn't have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

So we ended up just throwing it away!

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

Its easy to clean and maintain.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.

Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

Those go right in the garbage outside!

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

All this defeats the purpose of having a "hands-free" diaper pail!

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

We have yet to smell a thing!Whoever figured out this design is a genius.

The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

You can use any trash bag2.

If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!

A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.

Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.

One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.

Excellent buy and highly recommended!

(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.

I highly recommend it because it's a great value.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

You'll save a lot of money by using this one.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

You also have to CLEAN THE THING, its a diaper pail, you have to scrub it once a month...

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!

You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.

* What's not to like -- you use you're own bags.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I would not recommend buying that one.

The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!

The bottom is wider than the top so the diapers fill up the wider spot at the bottom making it hard to pull the bag out of the top.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

It fits about 15-20 diapers.

The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

It is a little tricky to open, but once you figure out how it's not bad.

You almost want to change the bag outside!

The only foul aroma you will smell is when you change the trash bag.

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

This one is the best of the bunch.

We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

Simply simple and brilliant!

You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

No refills to every buy.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.

In my opinion this is the best diaper pail out there.

I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.

Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.

you can use any ol' bag with this.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

So far, I've been very pleased with this item.

We compared this too the other one and decided we liked the idea of the common garbage bag better.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.

The genie because a problem with refills and odors.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

And I just changed the bag yesterday!

I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.

The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].

It contains the odor with no problem.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.

My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

But I've never tried it before.

The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.

Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

Please be more conscientious!

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper "dissapears".

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

Those go right in the garbage outside!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.

We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it.

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.

There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.

I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

Another draw back for me with the Champ.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

No special bags to purchase, no odors, not too bulky.

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.

No special bags.

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

You can be the judge.

I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.

We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

I can't say enough about this product.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

This is easy, but horribly smelly.

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

But overall, its been great.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

It is a waste of 20 bucks.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

(I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism).

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

We both love it!

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.

I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.

We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.

I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

And about having to change the bag often, once again we are talking about DIRTY DIAPERS!!!

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

Hold your breath!!!

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!

We'll keep it and use it, but we're hardly thrilled.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

Especially no special bags to buy.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

But it's just the nature of garbage.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

It is embarassing.

It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

It keeps the smell at bay pretty well and is very easy to use.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

I have had no problems with it whatsoever--it is very easy to use.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.

First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.

It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

The smell is negligible.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.

I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again!

It takes regular trash bags.

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.

All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

I put it together when I was on bedrest!

We don't have a problem with the nursery smelling at all!!

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

We change the bag quite frequently because it is after all a diaper pail.

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

It's a pretty easy problem to fix!

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.

Now you're taking out an extra bag of garbage every day or two!!

A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.

I have had no trouble with odors so far.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

I could not be happier with the Champ!

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

You can use regular bags instead of special ones.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

They both do the job :)

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

We change the bag about every 5 days when its full, which every 5 days is not bad at all!

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

But absolutely never an odor problem.

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.

Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.

It should probably cost half what it does.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

One ofthe best investments and inventions.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

It does contain most of the odors but not all.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.

Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

Hopefully just an error that will be corrected.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

Anybody need two Diaper Genies?

As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.

I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

We both just like the style and look of the champ.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.

I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star.....

Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

It's a cinch to change the bags.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

I don't believe anything is that perfect.

It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point.

While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.

This is a great baby shower gift!

(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well.

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment.

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

I can't say enough great things about it.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

If you're still picky put in an airfreshner.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

Mine usually chip when I caught them on the catch!

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

So far, I've been very pleased with this item.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

I have used it for 3 days so far and am just thrilled with it.

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

I have had no trouble with odors so far.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

It is just disgusting!

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!

It is a waste of 20 bucks.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

This is a wonderful product.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

It is easy to use and I never smell any odor coming from it.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

If you look at the picture you might understand.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!

They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.

If you look at the picture you might understand.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

But regardless, I would suggest that this over any other diaper pail.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

It takes regular trash bags.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

You can use regular bags instead of special ones.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.

I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

While they do lock, they aren't convenient.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.

they fit it perfectly.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!

I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

They are so easy to use.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

They both do the job :)

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

Also, a little Lysol spray doesn't hurt either.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

you can use any ol' bag with this.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

I have a two month old.

My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray.

The old one...

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

It also holds a lot of diapers.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.

It holds more diapers too.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

This product does not work for the following reasons:1.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

(I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism).

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

Hold your breath!!!

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

But absolutely never an odor problem.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!

I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.

It worked great for the 1st 5 months.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

It works great and cleans up very easily.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

You can easily take them with you when you go out of the house!

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

While they do lock, they aren't convenient.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

Sturdy construction, easy operation.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

It's very convenient to use as well.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.

It contains the odor with no problem.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

Please be more conscientious!

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it.

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

:)  But while it is closed, the odors are contained.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

It does contain most of the odors but not all.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

It also holds a lot of diapers.

It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.

It holds more diapers too.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

And I just changed the bag yesterday!

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.

When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!

i swear its air-tight.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.

If you're still picky put in an airfreshner.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

I still use it, and just put up with the smell.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

You can use any trash bag2.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!

A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!

No need to stick your hand inside.

No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

It "looks" like it should be a holy grail; better than the Stanley Cup.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

The other should go on your mantel to remind you of your supremely thoughtful purchase.

Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.

Would definitely reccomend this pail over any other!

I highly recommend thisproduct.

Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!

Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

I highly reccomend this product to all moms!!

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.

I highly recommend this product.

Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go.

If you're still picky put in an airfreshner.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.

Excellent buy and highly recommended!

it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item.

I highly recommend it!

But regardless, I would suggest that this over any other diaper pail.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.

I highly recommend it because it's a great value.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

If you have a sensitive nose I guarantee you will smell this pail.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

You'll save a lot of money by using this one.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

Go, Diaper Champ, Go!!

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.

I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.

So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!

Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.

Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It!

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

I recommend this to all my friends and family.

I highly recommend this product!

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out.

I definetly would recommend this pail to all.

You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

You put your diaper in flip the handle and thats it.

This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.

Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

I highly recommend it to anyone!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I would also recommend changing the plastic at LEAST every other day.

You also have to CLEAN THE THING, its a diaper pail, you have to scrub it once a month...

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

don't even understand why it would work better than anything else.

I highly recommend this product.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

Tie it up fast and you're good to go.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

I would recommend it.

Highly  recommend.

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.

I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

Get this one....

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

I plan on ditching it and getting something else asap.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

Highly recommended.

I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

I do recommend wiping it off every so often to keep it fresh.

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

I highly recommend it.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!

You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry.

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

As a first time parent I highly recommend this!

* What's not to like -- you use you're own bags.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I would not recommend buying that one.

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.

I would highly recommend this to anyone!

The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!

The bottom is wider than the top so the diapers fill up the wider spot at the bottom making it hard to pull the bag out of the top.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

It fits about 15-20 diapers.

The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

HIGHLY recommended!

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.

I am very ver disappointed with the product.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

While they do lock, they aren't convenient.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

Like I said, we were very happy with it for a few months.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

I love this item!

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

It is a little tricky to open, but once you figure out how it's not bad.

Just push down on the lever rather than trying to pull up.

You almost want to change the bag outside!

The only foul aroma you will smell is when you change the trash bag.

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

You never smell anything from these!

My time is precious!

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

This one is the best of the bunch.

Sturdy construction, easy operation.

We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.

So, I have extensive head-to-head comparison.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

Also, a little Lysol spray doesn't hurt either.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

I love it.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

Hey, it's worth it!

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

No refills to every buy.

I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.

Also very hard to clean!

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.

One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle.

When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

It's very convenient to use as well.

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!

All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.

In my opinion this is the best diaper pail out there.

I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby.

Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you.

Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.

I'd say look for something else!

you can use any ol' bag with this.

It stinks to high heaven!!!

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

So far, I've been very pleased with this item.

We compared this too the other one and decided we liked the idea of the common garbage bag better.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.

We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

If I would have known what I now today I would not have wasted my money and would have went for the real deal.

Please do not make the same mistake as I.

We love it's simple design.

Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

I have a two month old.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.

Bottom line: diapers smell in anything you put them in.

The genie because a problem with refills and odors.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!

I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.

We only have one tiny complaint.

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

No odor and it is very easy to use and change.

It's simple to use and is cost efficient.

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

no complaints from me on this diaper pail.

This is very easy to use and is simple to change.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

I expect that as she continues to grow I will just need to change the bag more often.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.

This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.

The easiest thing to deal with, no hassles, no mess, no smell, no problem!

It is easy to use and I never smell any odor coming from it.

This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

This is a wonderful product.

Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.

I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.

I have used it for 3 days so far and am just thrilled with it.

I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

It contains the odor with no problem.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.

But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.

My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!

But eventually, I found out that to keep it working well, you have to use a large enough garbage bag (instead of a grocery bag as I was doing).

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

But I've never tried it before.

The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.

Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

Please be more conscientious!

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

BRILLIANT idea...didn't have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.

I figured why not.

Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!

To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.

It is about darn time that someone listens to us parents and makes something that is not only economical but also looks nice.

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

When you think of the price of a refil, come on, do you need to think twice.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper "dissapears".

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

Love it, love it, love it!

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

Those go right in the garbage outside!

It works great and cleans up very easily.

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.

No smelly odors!

We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.

I love this diaper pail.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

It is very easy to use.

I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out.

The diaper champ is very easy to use.

The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it.

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

It's really gross.

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.

There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

Another draw back for me with the Champ.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!

Plus, there is no odor, even when it is full!

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

Wonderful item!!

at least once a week)  there is no odor!!!

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!

It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!

This is a great product.

It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

My SIL changes her bag every 2/3 days and she has no problems with odor!

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

The old one...

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.

It isn't all that easy to clean either.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

No special bags to purchase, no odors, not too bulky.

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.

I don't need that.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

So, the Diaper Champ.

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

On another positive note it is very easy to use and change bags.

No special bags.

It also holds a lot of diapers.

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

I have recommended this to all new parents!

You can be the judge.

I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.

We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.

We were originally going to get the Dekor (because of the looks) but realized once we saw it that we would have to change the refill bag constantly since it didn't look like it could hold much.

I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!

At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie.

Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

:-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

I can't say enough about this product.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

It worked great for the 1st 5 months.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

This is easy, but horribly smelly.

And a lot less expensive, too.

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

It is very easy to use.

I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

But our new one is completely worthless!

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

It is simpler to use than others that I have tried, and it is odor-free.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before.

Just drop in and turn.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

Its easy to use and easy to empty.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.

I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.

It holds more diapers too.

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!

Boy am I glad!

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

But overall, its been great.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

It is a waste of 20 bucks.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

There is nothing sealing the smells in.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

And the price is great also!

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

It's still odorless, and I hope it stays that way.

There is never a smell and is so easy to empty.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

This product does not work for the following reasons:1.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

The Champ is so easy to use and empty.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

(I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism).

I highly recommend this product!

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I would get this if I had kids.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

We both love it!

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

It so easy and so great I love it!!

I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.

I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.

To sum it up, the Champ made it a week before I returned it.One caveat: both my kids are eating solid foods.

This is much easier to use.

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

No exaggeration!

Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

During this stressful time; why add additional stress.

I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to.

I love this diaper pail so much!!

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

Just drop in and turn.

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

Of course, that is wonderful but it does not outweigh the things we don't like.

We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)

just to come here and write a review for this.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).

Like previous posters said, you do have to clean the thing!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

If you look at the picture you might understand.

It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.

It does what I want it to do!

Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

And about having to change the bag often, once again we are talking about DIRTY DIAPERS!!!

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

Very easy just to flip the top with one hand.

And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!

Hold your breath!!!

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!

I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason.

I am NOT a happy customer!

Especially no special bags to buy.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

I highly recommend that.

And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set.

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

It alleviates countless trips to buy a specialized item.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.

We have yet to smell a thing!Whoever figured out this design is a genius.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

But it's just the nature of garbage.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

But diapers with pee only do not smell at all.

It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay.

Great product!

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

It's not that much easier to use than the Genie either.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.

I will use it with infant diapers only.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

It keeps the smell at bay pretty well and is very easy to use.

I highly recommend this.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

It was well worth the investment!!!

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

I have had no problems with it whatsoever--it is very easy to use.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

I love that it's one handed and not hard to use at all.

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.

Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is?

First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.

It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

It makes chaging a diaper so much easier.

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.

Sure it saves money.

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

It is SO easy to use (even those unsaavy in the technology of modern parenting can figure the thing out...so grandpa and grandma can babysit, no problem) and the bags are a breeze to change.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

No spinning it or anyhting!

I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.

I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

The diaper champ is simple to use and no smells.

The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model.

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

This model is great!

You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days.

They are so easy to use.

All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

I put it together when I was on bedrest!

We don't have a problem with the nursery smelling at all!!

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

This pail does not smell and it's so easy to use.

Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem.

It is very easy to drop the diaper in.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands.

:)  But while it is closed, the odors are contained.

We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

It was the worst purchase I made.

It's a pretty easy problem to fix!

This is one heck of a product.

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.

I was wrong on the last point.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.

Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!

Now you're taking out an extra bag of garbage every day or two!!

A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

You can easily take them with you when you go out of the house!

Second of all it is very easy to use, even with baby in arms.

I have had no trouble with odors so far.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

I could not be happier with the Champ!

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

(3) Only one hand is required to use.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.

It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.

Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

The unit is very simple to use.

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

You can use regular bags instead of special ones.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

All this defeats the purpose of having a "hands-free" diaper pail!

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

They both do the job :)

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

We change the bag about every 5 days when its full, which every 5 days is not bad at all!

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

But absolutely never an odor problem.

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out.

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.

Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.

I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.

It should probably cost half what it does.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).

When it was timeto empty the genie you would need a gas mask.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

One ofthe best investments and inventions.

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

It does contain most of the odors but not all.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.

It keeps the smell OUT completely!

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

Just get some baking soda and it will be fine.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

So we ended up just throwing it away!

It's also easy to wipe down.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

Hopefully just an error that will be corrected.

This should run you around 35$.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

Its easy to clean and maintain.

Anybody need two Diaper Genies?

As others have stated, there is a trick to starting a new batch with the Genie.

The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.

I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

We both just like the style and look of the champ.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.

as a result we change her in the laundry room.

I love this diaper pail.

I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star.....

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

It claims to keep the smell of dirty diapers in.

It's a cinch to change the bags.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

I don't believe anything is that perfect.

Overall, we were satisfied with the product and feel it is worth the money.

It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point.

While some my complain that it's not &quot;odor-proof&quot;, you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you.

This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

I have advised all of my friends of this product.

It is easy to use & can take any type of bags... who has the time or the money to search for the special genie bags everytime you run out.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

I have been using it for 4 weeks so far, and have not had any problems with smell at all.

This is a great baby shower gift!

(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

Mine usually chip when I caught them on the catch!

This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well.

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

While it is better than the Genie, I found this product to be a disappointment.

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

I can't say enough great things about it.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.

Mine usually chip when I caught them on the catch!

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

It is easy to empty by just pulling up on the drawstrings.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

When you do change the bag spray with Lysol, and add a stick on deodorizer, or a car air freshener.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

During this stressful time; why add additional stress.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole  and make them disappear!!!

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.

You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

Also, a little Lysol spray doesn't hurt either.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

It isn't all that easy to clean either.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

It's not that much easier to use than the Genie either.

All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

You'll save a lot of money by using this one.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

Sure it saves money.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

I think it's worth the money you save from not having the special refil packs.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

Odors are nonexistent and the one-handed action is great!

Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.

I actually bought it seoncd hand and still I have not problems with scents.The great thing about it is that you can use regular garbage bags.

The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Another draw back for me with the Champ.

We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!

Oh, it does work at keeping the smells out, also uses garbage bags which is great, but if you look closely, the top is actually narrower than the bottom.

Let's face it - diapers stink.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.

Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags.

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again!

Fantastic capacity!

Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

No odor, easy to use, and large enough where I don't have to replace the bag every 3 days, like I did with the Dekor.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

However, after contacting the company, they are sending me a new gasket & instructions on how to install it.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

Oh what the heck, for the feeling it gives you at the shower you should buy two.

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

My only problem was that when I forgot to replace the bag, and had to dump the contents directly into the washing machine, it was extremely awkward and smelly, but I wouldn't recommend not using a bag, this was my own fault.

I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

Believe me, when you're only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, day-to-day tasks like emptying this thing (or eating  regularly or showering for that matter) will be forgotten.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

Every time we open it to remove the full bag, we find out just how great a job it does in keeping the smell out of the nursery!The only problem I've had was opening it.

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

Please be more conscientious!

You don't have to touch anything - just put it in and flip the handle.

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

It contains the odor with no problem.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!

If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

:)  But while it is closed, the odors are contained.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

It does contain most of the odors but not all.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.

I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.

A VERY SMELLY extra bag of garbage (it literally makes you gag when you take the top off of it!).

Just push down on the lever rather than trying to pull up.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.

I read the other reviews and have not had the odor problem that others have.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use.

Mine usually chip when I caught them on the catch!

I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery.

It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

But it's just the nature of garbage.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Just put the diaper in the hole and flip the handle over.

Very useful if you have a baby in your arms.If I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER use any other diaper pail again!

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.

SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!)

Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.

I recommend wiping it out with a disinfectant wipe each item as well as wiping down the part where you put the diapers into and flip.

The diaper champ is definitely easy to use and very convenient since you can use any bag.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

One caution though, be careful with the tabs from the diapers.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

(They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item.

But regardless, I would suggest that this over any other diaper pail.

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

Go, Diaper Champ, Go!!

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

All you do to dispose of the diaper is flip the handle, no twisting, squishing, squeezing whatever required.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

You put your diaper in flip the handle and thats it.

This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor.

:)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way.

You also have to CLEAN THE THING, its a diaper pail, you have to scrub it once a month...

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.

I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

I would highly recommend the Diaper Champ!

It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.

The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

The original Diaper Champ worked well but this one is horrible!

The bottom is wider than the top so the diapers fill up the wider spot at the bottom making it hard to pull the bag out of the top.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!

It is so bad I am considering buying another diaper pail even though I will be potty traing soon.

It fits about 15-20 diapers.

The diaper champ is so easy and great because you can do it with one hand.

So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money.

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

I'm now tempted to just get a basic 14 dollar diaper container and just dump them more often.

I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

Sturdy construction, easy operation.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

Just watch as they try to figure how to throw away the diaper.

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

The diaper is gone and the kids actually think it's fun to throw diapers away because they think it's magic how it disapears!!

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

All with one hand, I can load the diaper, sprinkle some soda on it, and kiss it bye.

It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands.

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.

One hand to drop the diaper in and then flip the handle.

When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great.

At this time, I am very satisfied with the Diaper Champ.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

In my opinion this is the best diaper pail out there.

they fit it perfectly.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber.

It is also easy to change out the bags.I really like the fact that you can keep one hand on the baby while flipping the handle to drop the diaper - it works really well.

I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again.

We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.

It only holds about 10 newborn diapers before it becomes clogged and stops working.

This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

Bottom line: diapers smell in anything you put them in.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!

I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.

Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3.

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

no complaints from me on this diaper pail.

The common complaint about the diapers catching is balogna ... when they don't go down, the pail is full and it is time to change the bag.

Hopefully, we can get another one for the new baby and maintain it properly from the beginning!This is a great product that really works.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.

I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it].

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

My son is in size 4 diapers and the Champ last a week without changing the bag or ANY smells!

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

I exchanged my Diaper Genie for this on the recommendation of a friend and I have so not been disappointed.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

BRILLIANT idea...didn't have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.

Plus the Diaper Genie has a razor on the inside, talk about safety issue!

My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

There's just something fascinating about the way the diaper "dissapears".

I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

I usually take the diapers out twice a week and it works wonderful.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

It's cheaper then the diaper genie and you don't half to buy any special bags.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

What a great diaper pail!

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We do change the bag about ever 3-4 days (keep in mind we have TWO TIMES the diapers) and wash it out frequently as well.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

I love this diaper pail.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out.

The diaper champ is very easy to use.

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!

I am constantly telling them not to put their hand into the hole the dirty diapers go in - Just gross since the diapers directly touch this area with no liner!2.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

So, the Diaper Champ.

It also holds a lot of diapers.

Let's face it - diapers stink.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.

I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!

At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

The Diaper Champ is the only way to go!!

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

It holds more diapers too.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

I love this diaper pail so much!!

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

I think this is b/c we do not use it as much, and diapers sit in it longer.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

I couldn't figure out the Diaper Genie in the daytime!

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

I did not know anything about the Diaper Champ when I bought it but it has been FANASTIC!!

Wouldn't b/c sticker on diaper tag traps in the weight thingy that pushes diaper down.

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

We change our son, put the diper in the champ and give it one turn.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

Since the diaper champ never seals the bag, you are confronted with an open bag filled with a weeks worth of smelly deliciousness.On the whole, if the foam ring never fell out of the dumpster, I would never have needed to replace it with another and see all of the Diaper Champs shortcomings.

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

But diapers with pee only do not smell at all.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.

I will use it with infant diapers only.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

It makes chaging a diaper so much easier.

NOTE: To help cut down on the smell, take the diaper and wrap it up using the tabs!

Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

The diaper champ is simple to use and no smells.

And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!

You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!

We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.

I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

Otherwise, I think I would pass out from changing the bags after the diapers have been 'brewing' in the pail for over a week.

I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

I originally had the wide open diaper genie but they stopped making the wide open liners for that model so I decided to try something new.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

When I read up on the DC I thought it sounded perfect, and i haven't been disappointed.

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

We change the bag quite frequently because it is after all a diaper pail.

Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.

It is very easy to drop the diaper in.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up.

It is also difficult to turn unless the diaper is smashed down as far as it can go in the cylinder.Do not waste your money on the New Diaper Champ.

Put the diaper in, flip the handle and the poop-filled Huggie and the smell with it, simply disappear.

It is very easy to remove stucked diaper.You should never rely on these things to keep the smell inside.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

All this defeats the purpose of having a "hands-free" diaper pail!

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

We actually still keep both around - and use the Diaper Genie for the bad diapers and for the quicky changes we use the Diaper Champ.

It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

I dont find it to be a hassle having to do this as i always did this before i had the diaper champ.

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.

Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

Anybody need two Diaper Genies?

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

I love this diaper pail.

I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

It claims to keep the smell of dirty diapers in.

I don't believe anything is that perfect.

This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

This thing is great to just put diaper in and flip and no special bags.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.

We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001!

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

With our first child we registered for and received the diaper genie.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

It is so convenient and easy to use, I would never want to be without it.

This a great buy, you can use any type of plastic bag you want.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

You almost want to change the bag outside!

And as for emptying it too often, I have never emptied ours more than once a week, and besides, would you REALLY want to leave old diapers sitting around any longer than a week??

My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).

But without that visual of knowing when it's full (for any of these diaper products really), it will undoubtedly be the full when you least want it to be.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

I want to start by saying that there isn't a diaper pail in existence that will keep smells out of your house 100%.

It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

It does what I want it to do!

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is?

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

You also have to CLEAN THE THING, its a diaper pail, you have to scrub it once a month...

But other than that, the more you scrub this, I think the worse it will get.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

We change the bag quite frequently because it is after all a diaper pail.

It's also quite attractive for a diaper pail (quite high tech and sanitary looking).

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

I am starting to potty train my son, but he still has mistakes in diapers, so this still gets use.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

As baby gets older, you have to change more frequently - which is OK since you can use your own bags.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.
