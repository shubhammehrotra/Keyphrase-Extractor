Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

Any possible smell is locked in, you carry it outside then open lid to change bag so no smell is ever lingering in the house.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

You never smell anything from these!

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

It is easy to use and I never smell any odor coming from it.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

I also like the review regarding not disposing of the really smelly ones in the pail.

It takes regular trash bags.

I've read the bad reviews about the smell factor, but I still recommend this product.

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

My doctors office has one in the lobby as well for dirty diapers and you can't smell a thing.

It is so easy to operate, doesn't smell (with Diaper Genie you get a malodorous whiff every time you open the lid!)

Despite my son's normally rancid diapers, I can't smell a thing!

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great.

We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

You can use any trash bag2.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.

Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly.

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

The only foul aroma you will smell is when you change the trash bag.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!!

My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.

Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.

We're spending more on trash bags then we would on Diaper Genie bags.

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

We preferred this model over the newer model.Its easy to use and doesn't need any special bags.We change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ once, maybe twice a week.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.

It takes regular trash bags.

You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.

Its easy to open and remove bag when its time to change the trash bag.

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.

Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

Plus, you can use any standard garbage bags.

I use scented trash bags and spray it out with Lysol after each changing and it has yet to smell.

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review.

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

This is a wonderful product.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

I do like how you can use ANY garbage bag though.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

The greatest part to us, was that you could use oversized plastic shopping bags, etc and we just keep emptying and reusing the same bag over and over.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

As a first time parent I highly recommend this!

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

I have since borrowed a Diaper Genie and have seen a HUGE improvement in odor control.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

Like I said, we were very happy with it for a few months.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.

It worked great for the 1st 5 months.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.

I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.

my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).

It is a little tricky to open, but once you figure out how it's not bad.

Also, a little Lysol spray doesn't hurt either.

since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

First, because of the fact that the diapers are not sealed into little "sausages"  like the Diaper Genie, the Champ can produce quite a smell.

(I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism).

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

Because it's a little taller and doesn't have sausage links (by the way, that's a really negative when it comes time to empty), it holds more diapers.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

SPRAY OUST or some air freshner INSIDE pail before putting in new bag and spray a little inside the actual new bag, and then a quick spray outside pail around it.4.

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.

Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck.

Now her room reeks after every poopy diaper so we either have to empty this thing once or twice a day - which is very wasteful and inconvenient - or put up with the smell, which of course, we are not willing to do.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

So if you own one, or wanna buy one its TERRIFIC, it works "okay" without my little tips, but to keep the room fresh I would try it out, but if you dont know if you wanna buy one...

I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

I empty it every other day so that his room doesn't have the odor of dirty diapers.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

We have ours in our bedroom and we do not have any diaper smell whatsoever!

I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room.

Think about it, would you put a garbage can with rotting food in the baby's room?

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

and currently our daughter is still in with us in the bedroom, so that means the diaper pail is as well.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

Takes up unnecessary space, especially if your child does not have the largest of rooms!

Our little boy's room was smelly when we would open the door to get him up for the day.

as a result we change her in the laundry room.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

I use scented bags in the diaper pail, I have a deoderizer stuck on the inside of the pail, and I have an odor neutralizer on the outside of the pail.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

*A helpful hint* use any odor shield trash bag and you really will not have to worry about those smelly diapers!

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

Anything that houses human waste will only go so long before an odor kicks in.

It is easy to use and I never smell any odor coming from it.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.

The genie because a problem with refills and odors.

Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

No smelly odors!

I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out.

It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.

We replaced it with the NEW Diaper Genie and we have NO more odors (even after 6 or 7 dirty diapers), so we know that it was the pail!

No special bags to purchase, no odors, not too bulky.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

I changed my trash bags often, put dirty diapers in Ziploc bags, sprayed Lysol, bought a Glade plug-in:)...still smelled odors.

Besides, from the reviews and friends' comments, they do not eliminate odors completely either.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay.

This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.

:)  But while it is closed, the odors are contained.

I have had no trouble with odors so far.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

(If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).

It does contain most of the odors but not all.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.

The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile.

Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.

We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.

Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

If you are conservation minded at all, you will appreciate that you can use any bag (including recycled ones) and it only uses one bag to hold a mess of diapers.

The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up.

My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!

AND you can use regular trash bags & dispose of the diaper with one hand!

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

It takes regular trash bags.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

The champ is easy to use (just drop in and flip), we have NO smells, and you can use regular trash bags.

Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

great product, does what is supposed to do, and the best thing is that you don't need to buy refill bags (like Diaper Genie) you end up saving money that can go to diapers or formula...

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

In fact, I'm buying the Diaper Champ for everyone I know who's having a baby shower, so they don't make the same mistake we did!

This is a great baby shower gift!

We compared this too the other one and decided we liked the idea of the common garbage bag better.

You never smell anything from these!

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

You can use regular supermarket plastic bags in it, it's so easy to empty, and I haven't had any problems with smells from this product.

You don't have to keep buying specific bags for it.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!!

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

With the Diaper Champ, I can keep one hand on baby while disposing of the diaper with the other and best of all, no refills.

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

So what if the refills are $5, do you pay (usually) to throw anything else away?

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

No refills to every buy.

The genie because a problem with refills and odors.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.

Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!!

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell!

I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.

when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it....unlike the Diaper Genie!

I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).

Out of all the new baby items we registered for, this one has no flaws that we can think of.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.

Having raw sewage sitting in your house will never smell good, so matter what product you use to try and cover it up -

Tie it up fast and you're good to go.

The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.

Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free.

It's easy to operate and looks good in my daughter's nursery.

My solution wound up being a good Simplehuman trashcan.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

That became an after thot on the first day of a few good poops.

It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS!

I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new.

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.
