The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

It's not too loud but it can possibly disturb a sleeping baby.-- the latch that allows the whole top to be lifted up in order to change the bag is in an awkward position and is a little tough to pull open.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

You can use regular bags instead of special ones.

I highly recommend this for every mom-to-be or new parent!

The Diaper Champ is highly recommended by this new parent!!!

I have recommended this to all new parents!

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ.

Reuse those plastic grocery bags for dirty diapers.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

It is easy to use, fairly inexpensive, and works great!

The added convienance of using standard trash bags is a major and inexpensive bonus!

You dont need to purchase expensive bags for it to be effective so even if you pay more up front.

And it's inexpensive!

No annoying refill bags (expensive; and am I the only one who fears realizing I'm out of refills at a critical moment?)

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

And a lot less expensive, too.

Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags.

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

I mean aprox 200-250 bags a year is only six bucks!

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

I now have a 2 year old and this only needs to be emptied weekly.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.

That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.

Simply simple and brilliant!

We love it's simple design.

It's simple to use and is cost efficient.

This is very easy to use and is simple to change.

It is simpler to use than others that I have tried, and it is odor-free.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

Once you get the hang of opening the Champ everything else is simple.

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution.

The diaper champ is simple to use and no smells.

It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the &quot;Keep it simple&quot; principle.

The unit is very simple to use.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

Get the wipe in there really good to be sure you are reaching the foam.

Make sure the bag is inserted correctly (not sticking out of the Champ).Getting clogged?

This thing is awesome and I highly recommended it to all!If you want an odor free room for your baby go with the Diaper Champ for sure!

Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC.

When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.

It latches very tightly.My advice if you have already purchased this pail is to make sure that absolutely no "residue" whatsoever is outside of the diaper.

Otherwise, you'll notice the smell for sure...as you're digging through the trash bag to recover said object.Outstanding product.

*  ALWAYS make sure the diaper has made it all the way to the pail, or there will be backage.

And when you change the bag, the odor of the diapers remains, so you have to either wipe the pail down with Clorox or PineSol, and for added measure, spray it with Lysol.

My advice is to make sure that you attach the tabs of the diaper back onto the diaper itself before stuffing it into the tube -- this helps avoid the snag.

We change bags twice a week (I'm sure as our boy gets older, it will have to be more frequent!).

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught).

Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure.

I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it.

If you just just toss the diapers into it, sure they could get stuck.

And use an antibacterial wipe out the chute about once a week.To contain smell and mess, we make sure that each diaper is securely closed before placing the diaper inside.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

I'd say find a cheap 5-10 dollar garbage pail with a tight lid and use my advice...

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

The pail locks tight against curious toddlers, it uses regular garbage bags instead of expensive inserts like the diaper genie that really don't keep the odor locked in any better anyways, and it is easy to use.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

If you follow these simple steps, you will be happy:1.

Like I said, we were very happy with it for a few months.

We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since.

and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.

I am NOT a happy customer!

I'm also happy with the amount of diapers that it holds.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

I am having my second baby and this is one of those things that i call useless baby stuff that i wouldn't buy again.

So I bought two - one for the one year old, and another for my second child, on the way.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

In fact, we actually bought a second one for our lower level where I spend most of the daytime hours with our son.

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

It does a pretty good job of keeping the smells away.

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

I have a two month old.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners!

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

It seems like we change diapers all the time and it holds so many!

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

Perhaps a larger size should be made for larger diapers, though holding too many might defeat the purpose.

Also, be sure not to try to stuff too many more diapers in once the Champ is full -- you could break the "piston" as my over-zealous husband did with our first Champ.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

You also have to CLEAN THE THING, its a diaper pail, you have to scrub it once a month...

And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!

Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!

Like I said, we were very happy with it for a few months.

I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!

So in the last few months, the smell becomes noticible in the room after only a few diapers have been added and the smell is really strong when you change bags.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.

At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Baby Trend will not provide replacemdnt parts after 6 months and even then only with a reciept.

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).

I have a two month old.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old.

I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

We have emptied it about once or twice a week so far (our son is 5 months) and that has been enough.

After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ.

It worked great for the 1st 5 months.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

My baby is only 5 months old, but it seems to keep odor in great so far.

After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

We've used the Diaper Champ for two months now and it's been working very well.

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered -PROS - Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

We went through 2 diaper genies in less than a week before we said forget it and bought this 4 months ago.

First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

My only complaint is that after 15 months of use, mine does not hold the odor as well.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.

I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.

For those people who complain endlessly about the smell of dirty diapers emanating from the area around the Diaper Champ, I have one suggestion - take out the diapers more often.

Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!

I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet.

It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.

I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.

I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

(referencing other people's reviews) but this pail does NOT do the job.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

No need to stick your hand inside.

It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!)

The Champ is much easier to use, much cheaper, and has much more capacity.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

We found its easier to do, and more accurate if you open the system, and dispose of the diaper with two hands.

It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room.

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

I have a 3 week old and have got the genie upstairs and the champ downstairs - both hold off our odors, but the champ is MUCH easier and quicker and quieter to use!

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

This is much easier to use.

It's not that much easier to use than the Genie either.

It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.

It makes chaging a diaper so much easier.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

We like to use drawstring garbage bags, which makes it easier to close up the nasty mess before toting it right out to the outside garbage can.For twins and other multiples, the Champ beats the Genie hands down because of its volume and its use of inexpensive regular garbage can liners.

The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

I bought it at the store, 29.99, I clipped a coupon out of the Sunday paper for 20% off any one item at Toys R Us, so I ended up paying a little over 20.00 for it.

I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

I use the plastic bags from the grocery store.

(though you need to change the bag after 7 days or so if the weather is warm, but the same is true with the Genie...I mean come on now...it is a bag of poo and pee).So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store.

I now use scented garbage bags (much economical, purchased from the dollar store).The dogs would attack the Diaper Genie because of the smell.

And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.

If there is, all you need is a little baking soda on the bottom.

You won't be wasting money w/ this purchase.

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

I'm not certain, but my best guess is that the seal on the main piston degrades afer time (that's why the positive reviews you read are for the most part from owners of less than 6 months).It's only slightly better than an open diaper pail, but does have the advantage of keeping little ones out of the dirty diapers.So my review is 1 - Star if used as designed.

Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag.

I should be able to convince my wife to give away the Genies since we got them for free as shower gifts; my only hesitation being that someone else would have to use them.

:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

*  When preparing to open the Champ, either (1) keep your baby strapped into the changing table, (2) set them down on the floor or into a confined area, or (3) hand the baby to someone with free hands... Why you may ask?

I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell.

The best part is that we were able to use regular trash bags.

I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.

It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained.

It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell!

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go.

The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.

If you "package" the diapers with the fasteners before putting them into the pail you will be able to fit more, plus it also helps with odor control.

I suppose that could also be viewed as a positive since I know my curious toddler won't be able to get into it!

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table.

I also like being able to use regular garbage bags and even those plastic shopping bags which is great and very economical.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

Now I lift the lid everytime I use it.

Sure it saves money.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

My childs clothing - including cloth diapers - are virtually stain free.I highly recommend this item.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

You'll save a lot of money by using this one.

We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.

Now, I understand this pail is not marketed for use with cloth diapers so I won't hold that against it, however just in case you are considering it for such a purpose as I did, DON'T.The last complaint I have with this pail is that after only 2 months of use the inner seal broke and fumes were all over the room.

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

We do empty it at least twice a week, but our baby uses a lot of diapers.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top.

It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

It also holds a lot of diapers.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

And a lot less expensive, too.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill.

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

We decided to buy the Diaper Champ after the second baby 'cause we heard such good things about it - and now with 2 kids we knew we would be filling it up a lot.

It is a fabulous diaper pail--great for cloth or disposable and no odors!

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

we have been using cloths since then (she is 4 mo) and there is no odor problem.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

I used a Diaper Genie with my first set of twins, and ended up switching to a regular garbage pail to save money.

If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

Boy am I glad!

I chose this one because I don't have to buy the silly refill cartridges, and I'm glad I made that decision.

I am so glad I chose it over the diaper genie.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

The bottom is wider than the top so the diapers fill up the wider spot at the bottom making it hard to pull the bag out of the top.

Also very hard to clean!

I had with my first child was only used a month or so and then I just used the outside trash because it was such a pain.I only gave it 4 stars because it is hard to open (I've also broken a nail trying to do it) and I wish the top unhinged all the way; it has a tendancy to slam back shut.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.

It's hard to move the knobs let alone twist them.$40 for a used diaper champ... not worth it.

This creates a tighter seal and helps to reduce odor.One thing, the diaper champ cover is damned hard to open.

If you want to do it with one hand, you'll need to step on the bottom of the champ first and then pull up hard.I have another baby on the way, but have already sold my diaper champ.

It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.

The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky.

It is not odorless, it is hard to change, and not the greatest product ever.

It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice.

The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough.

We'll keep it and use it, but we're hardly thrilled.

I love that it's one handed and not hard to use at all.

You can usually get 2-3 hard flips before you must change the bag because you can't fit any more in.

However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.

Sometimes you have to push the &quot;weight&quot; down after you flip the handle, but that just means that the pail is full and you need to change the bag.

But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

You don't have to worry about if you twisted the top enough times, tying knots in the plastic liner before the diapers go everywhere, how to cut the plastic, spending "money" for refills, etc.

Just throw your folded up diaper in the openning on the top and flip the handle the other way and its gone (one thought here that I should note...I have had to fish "Pink Bunny" out of the Diaper Champ a few times during nap time...so consider this too when easy to use is a factor in your purchace.

Sometimes you may have to shake it a little because of the way the diapers tend to pile on top of each other, but besides that, it is a wonderful product that lives up to its promise!

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

We read the reviews for the Diaper Champ and thought we would give it a try.We saw that some of the problems were that poopy diapers could be messy and that sometimes the smell leaks through.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

He is now 6 weeks and it is getting a little more smelly and sometimes you can smell it when you walk past it in the nursery.

We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose.

There is sometimes a smell when you empty it, because you are pulling out a trash bag with smelly diapers in it.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

This is also not sanitary, as placing the diapers inside the hole sometimes causes 'stuff' to wipe off on the inside.

Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.

It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.

It has only stopped up a couple of times for me, but I just move the handle back and forth and it always comes unclogged and it is usually when it needs to be changed.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

At that point I either change the bag, or if I want to get a few more diapers in before I change it, I just gently bounce the pail up and down a few times and I am able to get more diapers inside.

But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

I do remember some odor associated with this product but as I recall those were the times it was getting pretty full!

At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.

The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through.

The Diaper Champ required less assembly than indicated in the manual, and the mechanism is quite clever.

It is important to really fold in the sticky tabs on the diapers, or they will become stuck in the works and jam up the whole mechanism.Otherwise, it's great!

(I know, that's weird - but it really is a cool little mechanism).

My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick.

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

I'm not one to write negative reviews without including positives.

Older son also pulls this over way more than he ever did with the Genie, and unfortunately, once he figured how the handle flips over, he puts things down inside the hole and flips the handle, so a few of his smaller toys have ended up down in the bag with the diapers.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ.

We've been using ours for going on 5 years and it works wonderful.

My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second.

She would have to change the bag in the Diaper Genie every half day if she had that!

I have a friend that has the Diaper Genie and he has the same issues we have, but he also has to purchase the special liners.The ONLY complaint I have is, you must simply make sure the tape is tucked away and this champ will work and work and work.

To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL!

They are so easy to use and don't require expensive refills.

So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!

No smell, no mess, truely one-handed and no expensive refills to have to buy and with gas prices, that is just extra when you have to drive to the store right?!?

We purchased a convenient, odor-containing pail for a reasonable price and we don't have to purchase expensive refills.

I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

It is easy to toss a diaper, wipes, etc in while you are changing so you don't have a mess on your changing table and then you can wait until you are through to turn the handle (which can be done easily with one hand).

Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work.

We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum.

I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.

We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes.

I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too.

I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

Cleaning the pail is a must, it does hold dirty diapers!We found that the best "diaper solution" is not to just let the pail do all the work (pretty much common sense if you ask me!)

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

Also, it's great that you only need one hand to operate it so that you can still hold on to the baby.

Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open.

I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!

There is a smell when changing the bag, but it isn't anydifferent than changing a kitchen trash can.

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

Now we just put the diapers in regular grocery bags and throw them in the kitchen trash.

I buy the cheap storebrand kitchen trash bags from my supermarket, which come in a package of 15 or 20 for less than $2, and lasts me MONTHS!

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.

!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags.

The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier.

It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.

I went out and bought the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen bags (hint: buy the powder scented kitchen bags) its so great you never have to open a lid and have that terrible smell hit you.

And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen!

It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!

We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!

They are cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags and the tall kitchen bags that go in the Diaper Champ; and much cheaper than those little blue baggie things.

I use the drawstring tall kitchen garbage bags and it works perfectly!

I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.

Do they even sell their proprietary bags in the regular grocery store, or would I have to make a special trip to babiesRus to get refills?

In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.

We eventually threw it out when my daughter was about 16 months.This is a great diaper pail for younger babies but can be too smelly as they get older.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly.

I am giving them as gifts to all my friend having babies.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

I understand that diet directly affects the odor of the diapers but since we use the babies room as a spare bedroom, it was VERY important to me that the smell stay contained.

I will say that I use the Glad Odor Guard bags (still cheaper than the Genie refills) and empty in my garage instead of the babies room.

It holds several days worth of smaller diapers.

What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby?

They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway.

As it gets full it will smell a little but what diaper pail with human waste would not smell as it fills up.

one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers.

I have 2 dogs and was a little worried about diapers being in garbage cans so after reading many reviews, got the Camp and wouldn't live without it.I have no odors from the champ, nor do I find that it gets dirty.

I know because when you open it to empty a full bag, it smells awful.

The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.

BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie.

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

As my son has grown and his cloth diapers have gotten bigger, it is sometimes a challenge to stuff the diaper and cover into the cylinder so that it can turn without forcing.

My new one will be sleeping in her big sisters room so a rancid scent in the room is not an option.

I just roll the diapers up, put them in the hole and flip the handle.One big benefit over the DG, is that I purchased a roll of scented 8 gallon bags for about $3 before the baby and I still haven't used all the bags - my daughter will be 11 months soon!

The design of the Genie also resolves the need to tightly close the diaper, and the problem of the wipes soiling the side walls of the Champs's chamber.Yes, you have to buy the cartridges, but stock up when there is a sale, and the extra money isn't such a big deal.Take it from someone who has had both, buy the Diaper Genie.

I have a 1 year old and the bigger the baby, the bigger the diapers.

Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

Also as baby grows and diaper gets bigger you need to manually push it down, and that smell thing.

Trust me people, there is a big difference from infant poop smell and toddler poop smell!

It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point.

I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good.

It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in.

Later, the wadding that keeps the smell in started to tear so since we were expecting a new baby, we decided to try the New Improved Diaper Champ.This thing is a pain, nothing like the first.

There is nothing sealing the smells in.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie.

We are also VERY careful to be sure any dirty diapers are sealed (by the tape) with the wipes wrapped up inside, so that nothing gets on the part of the pail where you drop the diaper in.

Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.

Fitting the bag and wrapping it around the interior gate is another inconvenience.A person really interested in controlling the stink is better off using any old garbage can lined with a bag, and on a daily basis changing it, and tying it off.

Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.

When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!

Hey, if it stinks, YOU NEED TO TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH MORE OFTEN !!

****Keep in mind you should have a ready supply of bags at your baby's changing station**** This also acts like the genies sauseges, you wrap the stinky ones individually.

I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

It stinks to high heaven!!!

Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!

the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink.

I could live with a slight odor (after all it is a diaper pail), but not a blowout stinkfest.

No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that!

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!

Let's face it - diapers stink.

if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room.

We've been using our Diaper Champ for over a year now, & though some stink escapes with the occasional "real dirty" diaper, it does control odor very well.

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement.

A toddler can flip over the top and maybe release a short blast of stink, but he can't actually get into the can.

I think the stink still exists, but other than that it is a decent product.Good luck.

The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky.

You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job.

(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food.

We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks!

!Now if you leave a bag full of stinky diapers in there for a week, then you're not using your brain.

If you use cloth diapers the diaper Champ is a must have, forget the diaper Genie it's a hassle for cloth diapers.

I suppose we could buy a second one, but I don't think parents should have to buy a new "diaper pail" every six months or so for $29.99.The other minor disappointment with the Diaper Champ, as many others have mentioned, is the difficulty of opening it to empty.

If any baby waste gets smeared around the chute, or in the sliding mechanism, that mess will need to be cleaned and that's a waste of time.

Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it!

Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo.

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

Which on the surface doesn't sound bad, but is really annoying when you want to wipe down the changing pad or clean up some last minute spit up/ missed spot.Pros:- uses regular trash bags- easy to change bags- tell tale signs of when to change bags (gets more difficult to turn the handle, and need to jiggle the trash can to create more room)- controls smell well- dog hasn't found a way into itCons:- can't throw away anything thin for fear of getting it tossed back at me

So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).

If I'm changing one of the kids diapers, my 2 or 3yr old can dispose of the dirty diaper while I put a clean one on my youngest.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.

Also very hard to clean!

At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...

I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing.

Also, it's really easy to clean -- not that it gets really dirty, but you've got to stay on top of it (again ... given what it's supposed to hold ....).An excellent addition to our baby's room ... you can also use it with one hand while you hold your little one on the changing table (no small benefit either).

I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning).

It works great and cleans up very easily.

but you have to keep the area clean, and do your part to make the area smell free as well.

I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray.

It isn't all that easy to clean either.

They're great for disposing of diapers when you're out, they're great to clean up messes in the car, and THEY'RE GREAT WITH THE DIAPER CHAMP!

You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.

No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out.

Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.

It is very easy to clean and I spray it with bleach water and wipe it down before replacing a new trash bag.

But I have also found that this pail actually smells less and the smell was easier to get out with cleaning.

Like previous posters said, you do have to clean the thing!

it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily.

Both had to be emptied and cleaned 2 or 3 times a week.

Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.

I just Lysol the bin each time I change the bag and it stays clean and odor free!!

Plus, it's easy to use, easy to keep clean, and uses any type of plastic bag.

If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of.

Its easy to clean and maintain.

Our baby is 2 months old now and we have not noticed any odor coming from the diaper champ.-- easy to clean.

Once a week take a couple Clorox wipes and wipe inside the hole where you put the dirty diaper, to clean any yucky leftover residue, flip the handle and do the other side, then wipe down the handle.5.

And a lot less expensive, too.

I thought about getting the Diaper Genie, but I didn't like the idea of having to buy expensive bags or using so much effort to dispose of the diaper.

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.

I just don't know that you can really expect "odor-free" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out.

So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands.

It's very convenient that you don't have to buy special (expensive) replacement bags for it and can use any type of kitchen trash bag.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money.

I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.

Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.

Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal.

I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.

We love it's simple design.

I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.

I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.

They have the kind that you remove a panel on each side of the box and the baking soda is inside of cheesecloth.

We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.

All you have to do is put ANY kind of bag inside the champ and close the lid.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing.

The chute doesn't go down all the way if you let the bag get too full- it's kind of your signal to change bags.

For the home, diaper champ is great, and is simple because you use what you already have.

I just put in a plastic shopping bag and then throw that into the kitchen bag when it's full.Visitors to your home may wonder how it works.

We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

But I've noticed in other friends' homes that are using the Genie, the Genie is much less effective at locking in the odor.

This fills up quite quickly, I have to change it twice weekly (stay at home mom), so it doesn't smell to me.

Also, it creates such a stench when you empty it that it forces you to do it outside of your home.

I always thought her room still smelled faintly of poop.

Just use grocery bags/department store bags and empty it every 2-3 days.

My only complaint is that when you flip the thing over to make it send the diaper into the bag, it can get caught, smearing the diaper's contents onto other parts of the pail (I know, ewww)if it isn't closed up tightly.All in all I like it and don't see any reason to buy another disposal system at this time.

As far as odor control goes, this diaper disposal system is awesome!The second positive quality of the Diaper Champ is that you can use any 13 gallon kitchen bags (or larger bags if you want to) to collect the diapers in it.

A major plus if you ask me, since everyone has some trash bags hanging around, and who wants to run to Babies'r'us or Target to get refills for their diaper disposal system when they have an infant to tote around with them.So in my experience, great odor control and ability to use any trash bag in the Diaper Champ is what makes it number one in my book.

My husband and I thought that the Diaper Champ would be the most logical, simplistic diaper disposal system because we could use our own trash bags and because we liked the simple "flip the handle" approach.

I got the Neat diaper disposal system first but gave it up pretty quickly since you have to squish your dirty diaper through a small slot & believe me you never wanna sqeeze a diaper into anything EVER!

I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED!

And if you get any mess on the unit... wipe it up with a clorox wipe or even a baby wipe.. comes clean easily.4) The side pops open easily, I have not sustained any injuries, broken nails, whatever or had any trouble opening the blue switch to change the bag.Really a great deal.

If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit.

I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

The unit is very simple to use.

Try dumping your solids in the toilet; that really takes care of problems like that too.

Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old &amp; now on solids) and her room has never smelled!

Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.

My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad.

As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.

Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper.

I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES!

My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!

I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.

We empty the bag about 2x a week and our child is on solids!

One ofthe best investments and inventions.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own.

I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails.

It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!

After reading several reviews on diaper pails, I decided to try the Diaper Champ.

I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.

I did not clean mine for 4 months and decided I should (although it did not stink) It came apart great.

Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

At least I know I'll have eight month where I'll breathe clean air...

Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.

It's much less expensive in the long run, since you don't have to buy special bags for it.

And a lot less expensive, too.

You would have to open it, shove a dirty diaper into a very small hole, close it... and than TURN a knob about 6 times for the diaper to make it to the base...CHANGING THE BAGS*  Remove the top off of the champ to access the bag*  Tie the bag closed, like a regular garbage bag*  Haul it to the OUTSIDE trash bin, preferably inside another bag to keep the animals away...*  Wash the container at least every other week, or spray it with a disinfectant, like Lysol or Oust.

My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones.

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone.

I recommend Diaper Champ to anyone looking for a diaper pail that actually works.

I highly recommend it to anyone!

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!

I would highly recommend this to anyone!

I would recommend this to anyone!The only downfall and why it lost a star is that it has a tendency to close when you are trying to change the bag and has torn more than one.

:-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!

I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.

Just take it outside right away was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did!

So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!

That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers.

Now I travel quite a bit, but do not even try to take my diaper champ with me- I think that would be absurd.

With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails.

I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply.

When I registered for The Diaper Champ I was a bit afraid I might be wasting my money.

I am so glad I did, I mean I for one do not find it the least bit pleasant to have to squish down a poopy diaper into a plastic bag with my hands (Diaper genie).

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell.

The little individual bags are super cheap and great for other things but if you don't have them, the poopy diapers can be a bit messy for this product.

Not only are the diapers the ultimate in smelly, but they are quite a bit larger than the newborn ones.

Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?

When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps.

And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip.

And thelist goes on.This product is a bit pricey then the rest, but it'sworth every penny.

I put an air freshener inside, which helped a little bit, but it still gets pretty stinky at times!

We empty it out often but even when we put a new trash bag and wipe it down and spray it down with lysol it still smells like poop.

(When done flipping the cylinder you do need to manually push the cylinder all the way down into the unit.)

I've already had several diaper tabs catch and stick to the &quot;chute&quot; mechanism, thus having to open the lid and unstick the diaper - thankfully, these were not messy ones.Lastly, the &quot;chute&quot; design itself, while a good intention overall, to help &quot;push&quot; the disposed diaper into the bin, I am finding that after about 6-8 diapers are in the bin, unless I physically shake the whole bin to distribute what's already in there, they just pile up one on top of another and then the &quot;chute&quot; doesn't go down all the way when it's flipped over to dispose of the most recent diaper in the &quot;chute&quot;.

Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!

Biggest advantages over it's biggest competitor (Diaper Genie)...  no costly refills, and you only need one hand to operate.

You can buy like 100 bags for the cost of one diaper genie refill.

Very cost efficient, and no stinky diapers in the trash!

It's simple to use and is cost efficient.

I do change the bags often...which is very cost effective since I use old shopping bags.

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie.

Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags.

You know they make the money off of the recurring costs of those refills and not the Genie itself.

A roll of 1000 bags cost me about $6 or $7 (which is about what one refill costs for the Genie).

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.

The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective.

I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one.

Definitely recommend it to all who are looking for an easy to use cost efficent diaper pail.

It should probably cost half what it does.

My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.

It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie.
