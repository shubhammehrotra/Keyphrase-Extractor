He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!!
Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.
I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it.
We loved it at first since it is so much easier to use than the diaper genie - you just drop the diaper in the slot and flip the handle.
:)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.
I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.
I love that you can use regular trashbags instead of buying special ones just for the diaper pail.
Now that I have used it for 16 months, here is why I still love it and recommend it to all1) No special bags to buy!!
I love this item!
I absolutely love it -- My son is only three months old, so his diapers aren't as smelly as they will be once he starts on solid foods, I know, but he HAS already produced some truly potent samples from time to time!
I love it.
We love it's simple design.
The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!!
My kids all love to watch the diapers disapear into the hole, they laugh at it every time.
Please, please consider this diaper pail, I garentee that you will love it, if you don't, they always have their return policy, but you will not need it with this product!
Love it, love it, love it!
I love this diaper pail.
I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week!
I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags.
It entices my older son to help me b/c he loves to put the diaper in and turn the handle.
We both love it!
It so easy and so great I love it!!
I love this diaper pail so much!!
I love this so much that I took time out of my day when my baby is sleeping (and Moms you know how precious nap time is!)
The latch is a little difficult to open, but I think that is a good thing since my eleven month old loves opening and playing with things she shouldn't be.
I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn.
We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.
It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!
I love that it's one handed and not hard to use at all.
I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.
I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find.
I love this diaper pail.
I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it.
