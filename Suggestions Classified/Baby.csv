6622	Seriously....trust me!	0	0.0036746556870639324
6623	The reason why it never smells is because the diaper goes into like a seperate chamber before it gets to the bag, so the air never transfers.Theres nothing else I can say.	0	0.024437038227915764

6626	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail...one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.Here's what we love about this pail...*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!!	0	1.1227852519368753E-4

6630	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.	0	2.4420206318609416E-4

6632	The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home!!	0	4.1718463762663305E-5
6633	It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs.	0	0.0029213656671345234
6634	I originally chose this one, because it doesn't use costly refills.	0	0.20253600180149078
6635	The lid is quite heavy, so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags, but that's the only concern I've had with it.	0	0.033157721161842346
6636	When you do open it to change the bags, you may want to do so outside.	0	8.323649526573718E-4
6637	You'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in.	0	2.326378016732633E-4
6638	We initially were very happy with the Diaper Champ- smell control was adequate, easy to use & cost effective to replace bags.	0	0.00594358192756772

6641	Then it became very difficult to turn the opening, kept sticking and getting caught.	0	2.6811438146978617E-5
6642	So we just finally took the gasket completely off which decreased the smell control.	0	0.0014718052698299289

6644	Our baby is only 7 months old and we have been through two Diaper Champs so we decided enough is enough and bought a Diper Dekor.	0	0.0021126733627170324
6645	We were disapointed because we didn't want to have to buy special refill bags plus we liked the easy design of the Diaper Champ, you could toss a diaper in one handed while your other hand was busy with baby, but the faulty gasket deal was too irritating.	0	8.051576151046902E-5
6646	Yes, it does develop a smell after a while.	1	0.6343892216682434
6647	However if you keep up with the maintance that problem is easily solved.Problem:  SmellAnswer:  Baking soda & regular maintanceThe great thing about the diaper champ is you can use regular bags, and it does keep the smell out.	0	2.2124123643152416E-4
6648	After some time with the Diaper Genie there was no way to stop the odor.Another thing, when the Champ starts stinking it is usaully past time to empty it.	0	0.031471412628889084
6649	Empty the champ at least twice a week, if not more.	0	0.009655390866100788
6650	We keep an air purifier in front of the diaper champ and that solves any strong smells when we don't empty it out on a regular basis.If you don't want to spend the money on the diaper champ, try a regular diaper pail with a lid.	1	0.7201563119888306
6651	You would more than likely end up emptying the pail daily and that will keep the smell out(plus regulare maintance), and it is less expensive than the Diaper Champ.There are three diaper pails out that are cheaper:Safety 1st Diaper Pail: 8 gallons it's  a bit small$9.99 at Target & Babies R UsOdorless Diaper Pail: 13 gallons bags @ Target $16.99Easy Saver Daiper Pail: 8 gallons $14.99 @ Babies R UsI have not tried any of these so I can't honestly review them.	1	0.9390647411346436
6652	These are if you are looking for cheaper alternative.	0	4.331282980274409E-4
6653	I would buy one of these over the Diaper Genie or Diaper Dekor.I still give it 4 stars.	0	1.9774648535531014E-4
6654	It does it job and a lot better than the Diaper Genie or Diapre Dekor, no expensive refills.	0	2.824775583576411E-4
6655	Everyone has kitchen trash bags that can be used with the Champ or regular grocery bags could be put to use.	1	0.5938500165939331
6656	The good thing about using grocery bags is you will be emptying the diaper champ on a dialy basis therefore elimating build up on odor.I have the older diaper champ and opening the lid to empty the pail was a bit of a hassle.	0	0.0012914324179291725

6667	Put it in the top hole, roll the top with the handle, in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor!As if this were not already great, there's a big plus to this product, when you compare it to its biggest competitor, the Diaper Genie by Playtex.	0	0.0011406205594539642
6668	Although this one costs $5 the first time around, it won't require special bags as the Genie does, which cost $15 per set... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco, BJs, Sam's or your local supermarket, so rejoice!	1	0.9601467251777649

6676	After reading many of these reviews, especially the 1-2 star reviews, we noticed that many people complained about the odor.	0	3.0752566090086475E-5
6677	There was a lot of concern about getting the odor out of the can itself, and of course the odor in the room.	0	3.880710864905268E-4
6678	My immediate thought was to use two bags, and this is working like a dream.	0	1.6130907170008868E-4
6679	You can replace both bags each time, or use the 2nd bag as a liner, and really reduce the odor (we don't smell any diapers at all) and we've only had to empty the can about twice a week (our daughter is going through 10-12 diapers a day).	0	0.02941253036260605
6680	We also keep the can in our nearest bathroom, where the odor wouldn't be offensive anyway.	0	1.3945299542683642E-5
6681	It's nice to have it out of the way and because we're washing our hands after changing and throwing out the diapers, it's very convenient.	0	1.5398174582514912E-4

7831,This thing lived next to my sidetable for the first few months and often it was only emptied when it was full (its pretty large).,0,0.006035167
7832,I used some simple tricks to prevent smell leakage:-Rolled and taped up the diapers securely before disposing-Always returned the handle to original position so that only one side of the opening stayed in contact with smelly diapers (you'll know what i mean when you use it)-Used scented odor lock GLAD bags and aired out the champ between bag changesThe only cons I found were that opening it is a bit tough ( you get more adept at it though and its safer) and there is a small opening below the handle which is where the odor tends to escape when it does.The cons are pretty minor given how well this thing works AND it is cost effective...i hate the idea of being forced to buy brand specific refills.,0,1.44E-04

7906,"I'm sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense here, I suggest you go visit the store and take it out of the box to see it to get a better understanding of what it does and how it's supposed to work.However, with all that said - I still think, for $30, it's manageable - I don't have a problem taking out the bag every other day, as I'd much rather use my own trash bags than spend more money on separate &quot;special&quot; bags that have to be used for a different kind of system, which can cost a lot more.If I had to grade this item - I'd give it a solid &quot;B-&quot;, it's just a hair above average, it does the job, but it's not all it says it is.",0,3.91E-04
